// scripts/tooling/check-read-only-guards.mjs
//
// A read-only guard may not sit in a GET, HEAD or OPTIONS handler.
//
// `PS_READ_ONLY` is a restriction on WRITES. `src/proxy.ts` enforces it by HTTP
// method before any handler runs, so a guard inside a read handler cannot
// protect anything: the method was already allowed. All it can do is refuse a
// read, which is how the mode came to blank the dashboard it exists to enable.
//
// That is not hypothetical. `requireAuth()` was a thin alias for
// `requireNotReadOnly()`, 34 read handlers across 33 files called it, and
// `PS_READ_ONLY=1` therefore 503'd /api/config, /api/models, /api/skills,
// /api/sessions, /api/monitor and /api/logs (T-0048). T-0034 had already fixed
// the same thing for one directory and written down the rule:
//
//     "A GET that refuses to answer under PS_READ_ONLY is a read-only mode
//      that cannot read."
//
// It reached 33 files anyway, because nothing failed a build over it. This is
// that build failure. WG-WEB-013: a rule that is not a red build does not exist.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A design-lint RULE. Those are single-line regexes with a path
// predicate, and this question is not answerable one line at a time: the same
// call is correct in a POST and wrong in a GET, so the check needs to know
// which handler encloses it. A stateful rule does not fit that registry's
// shape, so it lives here in the check-derived-views.mjs mould instead.
//
// Dependency-free, per WG-WEB-013. Run by `npm run lint`; exits non-zero on a
// violation.
