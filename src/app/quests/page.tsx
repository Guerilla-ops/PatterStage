// Quests — the programme, seven chapters of it
//
// Decision 4: real actions, proved by what PatterStage already records. The
// whole evaluation rides in on the /api/stats poll the shell runs anyway, so
// this page adds no endpoint and costs no request for the part that decides
// whether a quest is done. The three GETs it does make are about the HOST, not
// about progress: whether the agent, the memory provider, the Composer and a
// host scheduler are there to attempt four of the quests with.
//
// A failed stats read says so and keeps its Retry. It does not fall back to a
// page of zeros, which would tell an operator with thirty quests behind them
// that they had none (T-0096, the read contract).
