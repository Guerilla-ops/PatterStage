// Story Weaver — the library, at the door.
//
// This was a hub: six tiles counted from the stories, four buttons to the
// four other Story Weaver screens, and the three most recent stories. The
// library, one click further in, was three of those tiles, three filters and
// EVERY story - a strict superset of the hub. Decision 6 (T-0126) folds the
// hub into it: the rail's one Story Weaver entry lands here, the counts a
// reader came to the hub for are in the subtitle and on the filters, and the
// only door left is the one to a new story, because Characters and Themes
// are panels on Create now and this list IS the library.
