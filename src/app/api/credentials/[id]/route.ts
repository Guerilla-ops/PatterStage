// /api/credentials/[id] — rotate or remove one provider credential
//
// PATCH replaces the stored key. Before it existed the only way to change a
// key that had leaked or expired was to delete the credential and add it
// again, which unlinked every model pointing at it (T-0100, D14). The row and
// the Hermes .env variable move together, and if the .env write fails the row
// is put back: half a rotation is a credential nobody can use.
//
// DELETE removes a provider credential.
//
// Every piece of this existed before the route did. `deleteCredential` was the
// rollback path of POST /api/credentials, `removeCredentialFromHermesEnv` was
// production code whose docstring already said "Used when a credential is
// deleted", and `models.credentials_id` has been ON DELETE SET NULL since
// migration 001. Only the door was missing (QA finding 17, operator ruling 3).
//
// TWO THINGS IT HAS TO GET RIGHT.
//
// The `.env` var is keyed by PROVIDER and the row is not. `upsertCredential`'s
// docstring claims a unique constraint on `provider`; there is none —
// migration 001 creates a plain index — so two OpenAI keys can coexist and
// share OPENAI_API_KEY. The variable is therefore removed only when no
// credential for that provider survives the delete.
//
// And a model attached to the deleted credential is unlinked silently by the
// foreign key, failing at its next call. It is named in the response, at the
// one moment the operator can still change their mind. As information, never
// as a veto: refusing to delete a key that is in use would make it impossible
// to remove exactly when removing it matters most.
