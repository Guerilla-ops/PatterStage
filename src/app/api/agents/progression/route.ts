// GET /api/agents/progression — the recorded per-Body growth
//
// The read side of WG-ARCH-003. `/api/agents/experience` answers "what is this
// agent now", recomputed from history every time it is asked. This answers "what
// was recorded, and when", from rows that no prune can rewrite.
//
// Without a slug it returns the newest row for every profile. With `?slug=` it
// returns that profile's whole trail, oldest first, which is the read the
// append-only design exists for: after the events behind a level have been
// deleted, the trail is the only thing left that can say the level was reached.
//
// It captures on the way past, before reading. That is not a mutating verb: it
// is the same lazy correction the dashboard poll performs, and it exists here
// because the capture used to happen ONLY inside GET /api/stats -- so an
// install driven over HTTP never captured anything and this endpoint answered
// with rows nobody had written, while the spend figures beside it read live
// (T-0081, RC-A). Migration 031 still refuses UPDATE and DELETE at the
// database, so nothing here can rewrite what was recorded.
