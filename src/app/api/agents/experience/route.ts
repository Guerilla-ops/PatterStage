// GET /api/agents/experience — every agent's accumulated growth, ranked
//
// The Agent Experience Level was only ever reachable through the benchmark
// routes (leaderboard, agent-card, setups), even though nothing about it is
// benchmark-derived: agentExperienceForProfile reads completed runs, active
// days, enabled skills, attached toolsets and memory facts. When the benchmark
// subsystem was deleted this axis nearly went with it by accident.
//
// ADR-0004 keeps agent progression as the record of what an AGENT accumulated,
// and this is the surviving, honest half of it: everything here is a thing the
// agent actually did or was given, with no capability claim attached.
//
// IT RANKS EVERY AGENT, INCLUDING THE ROOT. It used to list `listProfiles()`
// only, which excludes the root agent at ~/.hermes -- the one a default install
// actually runs, and therefore the only agent on most installs with any work to
// its name. It was reported as `runsCompleted: 0`; the agent was simply not on
// the board (T-0081, RC-D). getAgentPerformance already includes the root, so
// the numbers existed the whole time and nothing asked for them.
