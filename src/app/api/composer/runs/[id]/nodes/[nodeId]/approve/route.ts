 * Explain the state we are refusing FROM.

 * The guard used to answer a bare "Run is not awaiting approval" while
 * `run.status` and `run.error` were both in scope -- and `run.error` is where
 * the engine's `describeStageFailure` already put the sentence the operator
 * needs ("Gate A was rejected and the workflow has no recovery path from
 * here"). The message existed and was thrown away one line from where it was
 * wanted (T-0069).
 *
 * This is a real race, not a hypothetical: the gate panel renders from a polled
 * copy, so a run that ended between the poll and the click leaves the Accept and
 * Reject buttons on screen. The operator's click then has to explain that the
 * decision has already been made.
