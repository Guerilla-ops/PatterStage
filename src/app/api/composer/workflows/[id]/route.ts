// /api/composer/workflows/[id] — read / replace / delete one workflow
//
// GET    — the full graph (nodes + edges) for the builder.
// PUT    — replace the whole graph atomically (the builder's save).
// DELETE — remove the workflow.
// Edits are blocked while the workflow has active runs (would orphan a run's
// current node). Gated by the `composer` flag + auth for mutations.
