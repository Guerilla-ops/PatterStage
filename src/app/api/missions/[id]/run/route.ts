// GET /api/missions/[id]/run — the latest run for a mission
//
// Lets the mission board resolve a running mission's PatterStage run id so it
// can stream live progress via /api/runs/[id]/events.
//
// No guard here, deliberately, and this file is the model its siblings were
// normalised onto rather than the anomaly a review once took it for (T-0034).
// Authentication is enforced once, in src/proxy.ts, before any handler runs;
// `design-lint no-auth-in-route-handler` fails the build on a route that tries
// to do it again. The thing the siblings carried was never authentication: it
// was `requireAuth()`, which only checks the read-only flag, and read-only is a
// restriction on writes. A GET that refuses to answer under PS_READ_ONLY is a
// read-only mode that cannot read.
