// GET  /api/spend — provider spend per period and per source, plus the
//                   operator's budget and the verdict against it.
// PUT  /api/spend — set, change or clear the budget figure, its period, and
//                   the hard stop.
//
// The validation here is the load-bearing part, and it is deliberately
// duplicated with migration 033's CHECK constraints. The database's job is that
// a dishonest pair CANNOT exist; this route's job is that a person who tries to
// create one gets a sentence back instead of a constraint name.
//
// The rule both of them enforce: a hard stop is only ever armed beside a figure
// it can be measured against. A stop with no ceiling would refuse every
// unattended dispatch forever with no number anybody could raise.
