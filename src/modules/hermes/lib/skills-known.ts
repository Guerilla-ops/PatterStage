// GET /api/skills merges the SQLite catalogue with a scan of the agent's
// skills directory, so a skill that is on disk and not yet imported appears in
// the list like any other. The toggle route asked only the catalogue and
// answered "Skill not in catalog", so the operator clicked a control on a row
// the product had just shown them and was told the thing did not exist
// (T-0103, D82).
//
// This lives under modules/ rather than lib/ because knowing where an agent
// keeps its skills is adapter knowledge, and ADR-0005 forbids core importing
// a module.
