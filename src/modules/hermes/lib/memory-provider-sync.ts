// PatterStage owns the answer: a `memory_providers` row says which provider is
// active and how to reach it. Hermes reads `memory.provider` from its
// config.yaml for its own purposes, so the two used to be able to disagree
// indefinitely, and this product used to resolve the question by re-reading the
// file it was not writing (T-0101, D64).
//
// One direction only. The database is the source; the file is written to
// follow. Nothing here ever reads the file to decide anything.
