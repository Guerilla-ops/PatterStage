// AgentGrowthPanel — what this agent has accumulated
//
// Replaces AgentBenchmarkPanel, which showed the experience level next to an
// Agent Rating and a six-axis stat radar. The rating and the radar are gone with
// the benchmark subsystem (org/decisions/ADR-0004): the suites were all closed-book, so
// skills, tools and memory could not move the number, and the radar's axes came
// from hand-picked domain weights with no stated basis.
//
// What is left is every input that was ever a fact rather than a score. Each row
// names a thing the agent did or was given, so the panel makes no capability
// claim it cannot support. ADR-0004's rule that every displayed number names its
// subject is satisfiable here in a way it was not for the radar.
//
// "Memory facts" is not a row (T-0125). The signal behind it is a hard-coded
// zero waiting for a count API that never landed (agent-experience.ts), so
// every agent on every install read "Memory facts 0" while the Memory page
// beside it counted real facts. A number that is always 0 is not a fact, and
// two numbers that disagree teach the reader to trust neither. The signal
// stays in the API, where a zero costs nobody anything.
