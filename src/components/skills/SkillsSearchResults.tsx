// ── SkillsSearchResults — what one catalogue-wide search box returns.
//
// The whole point of this panel (T-0032, INV-1). The catalogue is normally a
// list of collapsed categories, and a paged surface that filters only the rows
// it has rendered would report "no matches" for a skill sitting three pages
// deep inside a category nobody has opened. So search does not filter the
// view: it runs over the whole catalogue and REPLACES the view with its
// matches, active and inactive together, flat and paginated.
//
// Flat is deliberate. Re-grouping the matches would put every hit back behind
// a category the user then has to open, which is the wall the restructure took
// down. Each card names its own category, so the context is not lost.
