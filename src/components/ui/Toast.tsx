// Toast — the answer to "did that work?"
//
// This is the confirmation path for 73 `showToast` call sites, which makes it
// the most-used piece of feedback in the product. It was also, until T-0050,
// invisible in two separate ways.
//
// IT RENDERED UNDER THE THING THAT TRIGGERED IT. The overlay ladder is Sheet
// backdrop z-[60], Sheet panel z-[61], Modal z-[70], and this component sat at
// z-50 and rendered inline on the page while Sheet portaled to document.body.
// The Sheet occupies the entire right edge, which is exactly where the toast is
// anchored, so every confirmation of a mutation made from inside a sheet or a
// modal was covered by it. A QA pass reported "the dialog stays open and there
// is no toast"; the toast was there, behind the dialog.
//
// A z-index alone would not have been enough. Any ancestor with a transform, a
// filter or a backdrop-blur creates a stacking context a child cannot escape,
// and this app uses backdrop-blur on its overlays, so the toast is portaled to
// the body as well as raised above them.
//
// NOTHING ANNOUNCED IT. There was no role and no aria-live, so a screen reader
// was never told a mutation succeeded or failed, and a harness counting
// [role=status] found zero and concluded nothing had fired. That is the same
// defect as T-0036, where Modal announced itself as a plain div.
//
// AND ERRORS DESTROYED THEIR OWN EXPLANATION. One duration governed everything,
// so the reason a write failed disappeared after four seconds whether or not
// anyone was looking. A success is safe to auto-dismiss because the operator
// asked for it and it happened. A failure is the opposite: it is news, it is
// the only place the reason appears, and it now waits to be dismissed.
//
// AND THEN A SUCCESS DESTROYED THE ERROR ANYWAY (T-0096, D122). The hook held
// one slot, so the persisted error was replaced by the next routine success
// before it was read. The stack now lives in FeedbackProvider, mounted once in
// the shell; useToast() keeps its API and reads the provider. Without a
// provider (a unit test) it falls back to the single slot below.
