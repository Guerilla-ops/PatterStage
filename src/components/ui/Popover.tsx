// Popover — a trigger, a panel beside it, and one way to close.
//
// The behaviour is useDismissable's; this file owns only the chrome and the
// positioning, so that the ten components which each hand-rolled both get one
// answer to "what does an open menu look like" instead of ten (T-0122).
//
// The wrapper encloses the trigger AND the panel deliberately: a pointer down
// on the trigger of an OPEN popover must not read as "outside", or a toggle
// would close and reopen on the same click and never appear to work.
//
// What this is NOT is a listbox. It carries no role, because a filter menu, a
// disclosure and a combobox are three different things to a screen reader and
// the caller is the only one that knows which it is building.
