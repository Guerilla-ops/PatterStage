// MemoryProviderSettings — the one card that owns the memory connection
//
// Edit the active provider's host/port/bank and test it. The endpoint lives in
// the database (memory_providers), so it changes with no Hermes file edits;
// PUT /api/memory/config writes `memory.provider` into config.yaml afterwards
// so the agent's own file agrees rather than competing (T-0101, D64).
//
// This card is also the page's ONE voice about memory being set up. A first
// visit with nothing listening used to stack an orange "we guessed the
// endpoint" notice on top of a red "no provider is answering" banner rendered
// by the browser below it: two warnings, one fact, and the fields that fix it
// in neither of them. Now the store's health arrives here, the heading becomes
// "Set up memory", and the guess warning is kept for the case it was written
// for: something ANSWERED at an endpoint nobody confirmed, and it may not be
// yours.
