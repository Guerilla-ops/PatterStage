/**
 * Compact insights strip for the mission board — the status MIX and the success
 * RATE. Computed from the board data itself (no extra fetch), so it reflects
 * exactly what's on screen. Hidden when there are no missions.
 *
 * It used to draw four count tiles as well: Total, Running, Completed, Failed.
 * Those restated the five numbers the board writes on its own column headers,
 * a third of the way down a screen whose busiest problem was vertical space,
 * while the status filter beside them showed no counts at all. The counts moved
 * onto the filter, where a number says what you are about to filter TO rather
 * than what you can already see (T-0123).
 *
 * A mix and a rate did NOT move, because neither is a count: you cannot read
 * the success rate off a board, and the donut says at a glance what five
 * numbers say only after you have added them up.
