// ConfigYamlErrorAlert — the one place that says config.yaml is broken
//
// Extracted from the Dashboard (src/app/page.tsx), which was for a long time the
// ONLY surface that said so. With an unparseable config.yaml, /api/config
// returns {} , which is byte-identical to a legitimately empty config, so the
// Config index showed zero "configured" pills and every section page rendered
// its fields as "(not configured)" with no warning anywhere. It looked like a
// fresh install.
//
// That is not merely a reporting gap. The Config section page is where an
// operator goes to FIX the config, and until T-0060 typing a value there and
// pressing Save destroyed the file. The pages that lied by omission were the
// pages that led into the destructive path.
//
// `detail` differs by surface on purpose. On the Dashboard the useful sentence
// is that syncs are paused; on a section editor it is that Save is disabled
// because a save would rewrite the file from an empty parse.
