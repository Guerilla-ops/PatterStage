// FeedbackProvider — the shell's one feedback surface
//
// Toast had one slot (T-0096, D122). T-0050 made an error toast persist
// because it is the only place its own reason appears, and then any later
// showToast, a routine success from a background poll included, replaced
// that error before it was read. Every page also rendered its own
// <Toast>, so the achievement-unlock toast belonged to the dashboard and
// fired only while the dashboard was open.
//
// This provider is mounted once in the root layout and owns:
//   - the stack: three toasts at most, and a success never evicts an error;
//   - the achievement-unlock toast, on any page, from the same stats poll
//     the dashboard already runs (react-query dedupes the request);
//   - the quest toast (T-0111, B17), from the same poll. It was a child
//     component that rendered nothing, mounted inside the context so it could
//     call useToast(); the provider already holds both the poll and showToast,
//     so it is a hook beside useAchievementUnlocks now (C6, T-0143).
//
// useToast() reads the context and keeps its API, so the 73 call sites are
// untouched. A component rendered without the shell falls back to the old
// single slot; that path exists for tests and is not the product's.

 * fires at most once for the life of the mount.
 *
 * It also watches for the SERVER's half of the same rule. `quests.seeding` is
 * true on the very first evaluation of an install, before the latch has ever
 * been written, and on that poll everything the metrics already prove looks
 * new. Firing there would greet a fresh install that happens to have five
 * quests already met with five toasts at once, so a seeding poll only ever
 * seeds. A skipped quest never toasts: the operator said they were not doing
