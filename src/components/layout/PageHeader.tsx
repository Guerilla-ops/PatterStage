// This used to render its own <header>: sticky, full-width, with its own
// padding. That made the header a CHILD of the page, and a child cannot be both
// full-bleed and contained. The bar therefore either stopped short of the
// viewport (on /results/artifacts its bottom rule ended 180px from both edges,
// pointing at nothing) or the words inside it sat at a different x from the
// content beneath. AppPageShell now renders the bar and puts this content in the
// SAME container as the body, so the two edges cannot disagree.
