// boot-diagnostics.ts — one line saying how this instance is configured.
//
// A live QA pass lost THREE sessions to silent flag loss. An external watchdog
// restarted the server without the session's environment, nothing on screen or
// in the log said the mode had changed, and one session produced a finding that
// had to be retracted: "read-only lets writes through". It did not. The variable
// was simply gone, and there was no way to tell from inside the product.
//
// That is not only a QA problem. An operator who sets PS_READ_ONLY in one shell
// and restarts from another has exactly the same blind spot, and the flags here
// are the ones that change what the product DOES: whether writes are refused,
// whether the deploy buttons work, whether anything is authenticated at all,
// whether a whole section of the nav exists, and which agent it is talking to.
//
// PRINTED, NOT LOGGED CONDITIONALLY. A diagnostic that only appears when
// something is wrong cannot be used to establish that nothing is.
//
// NO SECRETS. This line is meant to be pasted into a bug report, so it names
// whether a token exists and never what it is. `HERMES_GATEWAY_URL` is an
// address, not a credential, and an override is invisible without it: the QA
// pass ran its mock on :8643 and spent time confused about which gateway a
// finding belonged to.
