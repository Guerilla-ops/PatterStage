// modules/types.ts — the ProductModule contract (ADR-0005)
//
// A module is a product surface that plugs into PatterStage; the console verbs
// stay in core and everything else declares itself here. PURE DATA, no React,
// lucide or db, because the e2e route matrix imports the registry from plain
// node, so icons are named as STRINGS and resolved by the sidebar (the
// hand-mirrored copy in tests/e2e/app-routes.ts had already lost
// /laboratory/artifacts).
//
// THE FIVE SECTIONS (T-0097, decisions 8, 11, 12 and 14): a module contributes
// links to sections it does not own (Research is Work, Artifacts and Insights
// are Results), so the section is named from a fixed list, every link carries
// an `order`, and the rail merges by section and sorts by order. The config
// tree is the Settings index, derived from src/lib/config/config-sections.ts, not rail data.
