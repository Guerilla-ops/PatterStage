// Replaces MissionSync's status.json polling / pid-liveness probes / orphan
// sweeps. The backend (Hermes) is the authority for a run's state: a run id
// resolves to a status or 404s. We poll non-terminal runs, write terminal
// state to the run + mission + session rows, and recover orphans on boot.
//
// Polling is the source of truth; SSE (runtime.streamRunEvents) is UX-only.

//   • backend UNREACHABLE past the deadline (the gateway-down case) → fail;

// chose no timeout; it isn't "stuck", just long).
//
// The two constants and the timestamp parse moved to run-deadline.ts so the
// mission API can publish the same instant to the console. The rule they encode
// is unchanged; it is now readable by the surface that has to explain it.
