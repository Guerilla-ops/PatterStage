// Replaces the Hermes jobs.json scheduler entirely. Each tick: select due
// schedules (next_run_at <= now), claim each occurrence with a DETERMINISTIC
// run id (so a duplicate tick across processes can't double-dispatch — the PK
// guard rejects the second), dispatch via the runtime, then advance
// next_run_at to the next future occurrence. Restart-safe: due work is
// recomputed from next_run_at, never an in-memory timer.
