// about a run but that it was still going, while the reconciler computed and
// threw away every tick the exact instant it would mark the run failed. Now
// run-reconcile imports them and `buildMissionRunView` publishes the same
// arithmetic to the mission API for the board.
//
// Two deadlines, distinguished by `declared`: the mission's own timeout,
// enforced even while the backend reports the run as started; or the safety
// cap, which bites only when the backend stops answering. An untimed mission
// the backend is happily running is long, not stuck.
