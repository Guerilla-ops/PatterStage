// db/backup.ts — take a database backup, and list the ones that exist
//
// The two irreversible buttons on the Restore page (restore-everything and
// remove-test-data) fired straight into the database with nothing to go back
// to, and the deploy path's own `.bak` files were invisible to the product
// that made them (T-0100, D113).
//
// The snapshot is SQLite's online backup, not a file copy: `getDb()` opens the
// database in WAL mode, so committed pages can still be sitting in `<db>-wal`
// and a naive copy would miss them. `db.backup()` writes one self-contained
// file that needs no `-wal`/`-shm` beside it, while the app keeps serving.
//
// Restoring is deliberately NOT here. It is a shell step the operator takes
// with the server stopped; the product shows the command and runs nothing.
