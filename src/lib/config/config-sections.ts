// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// config-sections.ts — the Settings index, as data (T-0097, D79)
//
// The index page carried its own grouping of section ids, the sidebar carried
// another in the registry, and the two disagreed: the page listed 25 of the
// 27 sections and printed "27 sections" over them. This file is the one
// grouping. The Settings page renders it, in this order, as one page of
// sections (decision 7, T-0125); next.config.ts derives the 27 redirects from
// the old section URLs to their anchors from it; and the e2e matrix visits
// every anchor from it.
//
// PURE DATA, like the registry: no React, no lucide, no db. The fields each
// section carries stay in src/lib/config/config-schema.ts (which the editor page
// needs and which imports lucide); tests/unit/b3-registry-regroup.test.ts
// holds the two lists to the same set of ids.
