// read-only.ts — one definition of read-only mode, and one sentence for it.
//
// There used to be two of each. `src/proxy.ts` had a private `isReadOnly()`
// built on `readEnv`, `src/lib/api/api-auth.ts` had another built on a local
// `firstEnvFlag`, and between them the tree carried FOUR different 503 wordings
// for the same refusal:
//
//   proxy.ts                     "(unset PS_READ_ONLY to allow writes)."
//   api-auth.ts                  "(set PS_READ_ONLY=true to allow writes)."
//   backfill-status/route.ts     "(set PS_READ_ONLY=false to allow …)"
//   cron/hardware, scripts/*     bare, with no remedy at all
//
// The second of those is not merely inconsistent, it is BACKWARDS: setting
// PS_READ_ONLY=true is what causes the refusal, so the hint told the operator to
// do the opposite of the fix. It survived because the proxy short-circuits
// first, which made it nearly unreachable and therefore invisible (T-0048).
//
// Two implementations of one sentence is how the two layers come to disagree.
// This module is that sentence, once.
