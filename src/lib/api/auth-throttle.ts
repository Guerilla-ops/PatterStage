//
// The `ps_token` compare is constant-time, which does nothing about volume, and
// `start:network` binds 0.0.0.0 (QA finding 13: no 429 at 130 requests). The
// operator ruled for a failed-auth throttle rather than a general API limiter.
//
// THE PENALTY REFUSES TO PROCESS: answering 429 while still comparing leaves
// the guess rate unchanged. IT IS SHORT: on loopback operator and attacker are
// both "local", so an unbounded lock is a denial of service against the
// operator; the ceiling is seconds and a correct token clears the record. IN
// MEMORY: a restart costs one window, and a table would put a write on the hot
// path of the one request an attacker controls the rate of.
