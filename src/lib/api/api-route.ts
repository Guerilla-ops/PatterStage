// route — one body for an API handler (C1, T-0136)
//
// 120 of the 169 handlers under src/app/api ended in the same statement: a
// try whose catch was one line, `return serverErrorFromCatch("GET /api/x",
// "doing y", error, "Failed to y")`. Six lines and two indents per site to
// say "log it under my name and answer 500 with this sentence". This says it
// once. A throw anywhere in the handler, the statements that used to sit
// before the try included, is logged under the route's name and answered
// with the sentence; a response the handler returns is passed through
// untouched, whatever its status. The API contract is unchanged: one call,
// one log line, one response (T-0005 and the api-logger's own note).
//
// The name is the log's key ("GET /api/models"), `doing` is what the log
// says was happening, `failed` is the sentence the client reads. A handler
// on a dynamic segment names the request in its log ("DELETE
// /api/artifacts/abc"), and that id is in the route's params; each of the
// three may therefore be a function of the resolved params, called only on
// the failure path, so the log keeps the id it always had. A catch that does
// more than log keeps its own try; the wrapper is for the shape that was the
// same a hundred times.
