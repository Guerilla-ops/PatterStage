// memory-error-copy.ts: the sentences the memory surface says when it cannot
// serve a request, in one place because three surfaces read them (the store
// toast, the health banner in the provider card, the dashboard's Memory row),
// so a sentence true in only one is a bug in the other two.
//
// Two rules, both learned the hard way. NAME AN ACTION, NOT A DESTINATION: the
// copy once said "in the memory provider card", and the health banner is
// rendered INSIDE that card (MemoryProviderSettings.tsx draws it), so it
// sent the reader where they already stood; naming Host, Port and Save works
// from every reader. PROMISE ONLY CONTROLS THAT EXIST: it also said "Choose a
// different provider", and there is no provider chooser in src/components/memory
// (Save posts `type: current.type`; config-schema.ts renders `memory.provider`
// read-only). A state with no remedy says so plainly instead of inventing one.
