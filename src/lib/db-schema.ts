// AT THE LIB ROOT ON PURPOSE (C7, T-0144), and not under src/lib/db/ where
// its subject would put it: these are extracted to a separate module so they
// can be imported by migration files without being intercepted by the global
// @/lib/db mock in Jest tests. Inside that folder the mock would reach them
// and the schema constant below would read as undefined in the very tests
// that check it.

/**
 * The terminal `schema_version` of the hand-wired migration ladder in
 * `runMigrations()`: the version a fully migrated database ends on.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE and not in the `@/lib/db` entry module. `tests/jest.setup.ts`
 * mocks `@/lib/db` with a fixed factory, so a constant exported from there reads
 * as `undefined` inside the migration tests. Hardcoding the number into that mock
 * instead would recreate the exact drift this constant exists to kill. This module
 * is never mocked, so the number survives into the tests that check it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DECLARED rather than re-exported from the last applier. That applier
 * imports this module for `getSchemaVersion` / `setSchemaVersion`, so importing it
 * back would be a cycle. The duplication is made safe by
 * `tests/unit/run-migrations-upgrade.integration.test.ts`, which asserts this
 * equals the last applier's gate, that the
 * last applier's gate is exactly one above the one before it, and that it equals
 * the highest-numbered file in `src/lib/db/migrations/`.
 *
 * Raising the head means bumping this in the same commit as the applier that
 * raises it. `docs/running/migration.md` carries the full going-forward rule.
