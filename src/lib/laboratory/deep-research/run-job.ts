// stamping the final report. Kicked off async by the POST route (fire-and-
// forget, like the mission queue tick) — the page polls for progress.

/**
 * Prepend an honest note to a report the run could not fully gather the evidence
 * for.
 *
 * The engine counted its search and visit failures and the caller read them for
 * exactly ONE case: EVERY search failed, which fails the run outright. Five out
 * of eight was invisible -- a report written from three sources instead of
 * eight, marked `completed`, reading exactly like a healthy one (T-0070).
 *
 * The note goes in the REPORT rather than only in a column because the report is
 * what gets read, exported and captured as an artifact. A number in a table
 * nobody opens does not stop a confident-sounding paragraph being believed.
 *
 * A clean gather gets nothing added. The caveat has to stay rare to mean
 * anything, and a banner on every run is a banner nobody reads.
