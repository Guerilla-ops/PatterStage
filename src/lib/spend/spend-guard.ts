// One function, three callers, all on the BackgroundScheduler (schedule tick,
// queued-mission drain, Composer tick). Nothing a human clicks reaches it, and
// tests/unit/spend-unattended-dispatch holds that as source-level fact.
//
// THE DEFAULT IS YES. The operator's ruling was about not being awkward, so
// the refusal is as narrow as can be: no figure, or stop off (clause 3, a
// figure warns), or under the figure, all allowed; at or over with the stop on
// is REFUSED with a sentence.
//
// WHEN THE DATABASE WILL NOT ANSWER the two directions are not symmetric. A
// failed POLICY read is no evidence a stop was armed, and refusing would break
// unattended dispatch on every install with no budget: allowed. A failed SPEND
// read while a stop IS armed means proceeding spends real money on an
// assumption it cannot support, while declining costs one hand-dispatched run:
// refused, and the reason says which failure it was. That asymmetry is why
// this file does not share the summary's blanket safeRead.
