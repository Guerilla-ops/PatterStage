// The panel had a "Cron Job" card and the board had a cron badge, both behind
// `mission.cronJob`, and nothing has ever populated that field: the card and
// the badge were dead code (T-0104, D68). The thing they describe is not a
// Hermes cron job any more either. PatterStage owns the timer, in the
// `schedules` table, and the composer's Schedule dispatch mode writes a row
// there. So the field is renamed to what it is, and this is its shape.

 * Why this schedule will not fire, or null when it will.
 *
 * "Scheduled" and "going to happen" are not the same thing, and the panel used
 * to show a next-run time for a schedule that had been paused, orphaned or
 * used up. The four reasons here are the four that are derivable from what is
 * recorded; the tick's own refusals (another mission is running, the spend
 * stop is armed) are not recorded anywhere, so they are not claimed here.
 *
 * Precedence is the order below: an orphan that is also paused says it is an
 * orphan, because that is the one the operator has to fix first.
