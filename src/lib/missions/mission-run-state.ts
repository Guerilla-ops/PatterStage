// mission-run-state.ts: "what is this mission doing right now"
//
// The mission board used to answer that question with one unlabelled
// clock icon and `timeAgo(mission.createdAt)`. For a dispatched mission
// that is the wrong number: a mission written last week and dispatched
// ten seconds ago read "7d", and the detail panel's "Elapsed" field was
// the same createdAt subtraction, so a run that had been going for two
// hours was indistinguishable from one that had just started.
//
// Nothing new is tracked here. The run row already carries submittedAt,
// completedAt, status and the backend's verbatim error, and the
// reconciler already knows the instant it will stop waiting for a run
// (src/lib/orchestration/run-deadline.ts). This module is the pure
// function that turns those facts into the four strings the UI renders,
// so the board and the detail panel cannot drift apart and neither has
// to do date arithmetic in JSX.
