// proxy.ts — the ONE authentication + CSRF + read-only boundary
//
// Next 16 renamed `middleware` to `proxy` and runs it on the Node.js runtime,
// so this file can read the token file directly. It runs before every route.
//
// Why here and not in route handlers: `requireAuth()` in src/lib/api/api-auth.ts
// never authenticated anything (it only checked the read-only flag), so all 100
// API routes were open to anyone who could reach the port — and BOTH start
// scripts bind 0.0.0.0, not just `start:network`. `next start` has no loopback
// default; with no -H it listens on every interface and prints the LAN URL. The
// naming used to suggest otherwise here and in the README, which made the
// exposure sound opt-in when it is the default. A boundary that each new route
// has to remember to opt into is not a boundary. This one cannot be forgotten.
//
// Three checks, in order:
//   1. read-only     — PS_READ_ONLY rejects unsafe METHODS (not, as before,
//                      whichever handlers happened to call the guard).
//   2. authentication — Bearer token or the ps_session cookie.
//   3. CSRF          — a cookie-authenticated unsafe request must be same-origin,
//                      so a page you visit cannot drive your control plane.
