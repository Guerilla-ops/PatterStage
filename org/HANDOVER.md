# Handover · PatterStage, 2026-09-12

This page is the one to read before touching the tree. It says where the
work stands, what was learned landing it, what is still open, and the exact
steps a batch goes through. Everything it names is on disk; nothing lives in
a chat.

## The K programme (from 2026-09-12)

The consolidation programme is closed. What runs now is the refactor and
clean-up programme, K0 to K19, from task T-0146, after the codebase review of
2026-09-11.

**Read these three first.**

1. `org/reviews/2026-09-decision-register.md`. Every decision the review left to
   the operator, re-verified read-only at `ce4ac1fd`, with each option's
   consequence, a recommendation and the ruling. Ruled on 2026-09-12: the
   operator adopted option (A) for all eight questions and, with them, every
   item's recommended option, saying "correct any of them and I will unwind that
   one".
2. `org/reviews/2026-09-codebase-review.md`, the review index, and its evidence
   companion.
3. `org/QUESTIONS.md`, Q-009 to Q-016, folded with their answers.

**Two rulings bind every batch.** A closed programme's oracle changes only by a
dated amendment its implementer does not author, for the one rule or key the
ruled item fixes (Q-015). Public contract means routes, npm scripts, env vars,
config keys and documented exports, not any exported TypeScript symbol (Q-010).

**What the verification found that the review had not.** `dev` CI had failed on
every push since 2026-09-05: 61 runs, 55 failed, 6 cancelled, last green
`d84b7528`. About fifty records from T-0095 to T-0145 landed on red CI while
this page said green, because no step of the landing discipline read CI. The
line below that said "dev is pushed and green" was true of the local gate and
false of CI, and that is the whole lesson.

**So the procedure gained a last step:** after the push, the pushed commit's CI
is read and must be green before the next batch starts.

## Read in this order

1. `CLAUDE.md` (the never-rules), then `org/START.md` (boot by mode).
2. `org/plans/2026-09-consolidation.md`: the programme, batches C0 to C8,
   the census that referees it, and the corrections each batch wrote into
   its row.
3. The last task record, `org/tasks/T-0145.json`, and `org/TASKS.md` (the
   derived live view) for the rest.
4. `docs/contributing/testing.md` ("Shared test doubles") and
   `docs/contributing/repo-guide.md` (the read and write rules) for the
   conventions the last batches introduced.

## Where the programme stands

`dev` is pushed, and every job was green on `7457c579` (2026-09-12; see the K
programme above). Every batch below has a task record, an oracle committed red
first, a gate by exit code, a mutation sweep against the committed tree, and a
chore commit carrying the record and the derived views.

| Batch | Record | What it did | Landed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C0 the line census | T-0135 | `npm run census:lines`, twelve measures, shrink-only | yes |
| C1 one route body | T-0136 | `route()` wrapper over 115 handlers; 13 routes keep their own catch with a reason | yes |
| C2 one type each | T-0137 | MissionDraftFields, ModelIdentity/ModelRow/ApiModel, syncSuccess/syncFailure | yes |
| C3 one way to write | T-0138 | `runWrite` in `src/lib/api/api-write.ts`; four helpers and toastFromResult deleted; Story Weaver reads on `useApiResource`; census reads by AST; lint rule `no-raw-write-outside-the-helper` | yes |
| (fix) Models page keeps its body | T-0139 | a reload no longer swaps the page for a spinner; found by C3's walk | yes |
| (fix) custom fallback identity | T-0140 | migration 042 (head is 42): a custom fallback keeps its typed name, provider, model id | yes |
| C4 the test harnesses | T-0141 | fifteen factories in `tests/helpers`; 130 suites adopted by six agents with per-file identity; census counts dbSingletonMock as a factory | yes |
| C5 comments that narrate | T-0142 | narration cut file by file (two passes, ten agents); code proved unchanged by a stripped-code diff | yes |
| C6 the page layer | T-0143 | eight agents over disjoint file groups: six design-lint rules to zero (the whole baseline, 369 to 0), the eleven effect reads onto `useApiResource`, 27 one-importer folds, two pages that swapped their body on reload fixed | yes |
| C7 the lib root | T-0144 | 65 of the 71 root files into fifteen domains, by codemod, with every import rewritten; six stay, each saying in its own header why it belongs to no domain | yes |
| C8 closing | T-0145 | the last duplication taken by five agents, then the census read against every target, the five misses recorded with their numbers, and the plan marked done | yes |

The plan's remaining ids moved by two for the fixes taken in between; the
plan header says so.

### The K batches, so far

| Batch | Record | What it did | Landed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K0 the rulings | T-0146 | the decision register rendered from the verification journal, 121 entries with a ruling each; Q-009 to Q-016 folded | yes |
| K1 CI green | T-0147 | six case-broken doc links, extract.ts's lazy imports as file URLs, the smoke's deleted route; plus a suite missing `navigator` and a census report cut at the macOS pipe buffer. First green CI since 2026-09-05, 63 pushes earlier | yes |
| K2/K3 the discipline | T-0148, T-0149 | ADR-0011 ratifies T-0144's protected-set edits and restores 47 closed records; `npm run gate` (nine steps, by exit code, tree-stamped) and `npm run sweep` (mutants as committed data, four outcomes) | yes |
| K4 the security set | T-0151 | the six review findings that needed no operator ruling: the URL guard's IPv6 expansion, the workspace guard's path test, one client-key derivation with an observable prune, file modes at every writer of operator data plus the copies already on disk, the x-ps-\* signing cases, and the Docker build context | yes |
| K5 the ruled security items | T-0153 | critic-04 forbids framing on every response with a body; app-06 leaves read-only to the proxy and keeps the six host-side guards; critic-05a documents the signature's body gap | yes |
| K6 the gates see | T-0154 | the raw-control rule 0 to 104; routesWithTryCatch 13 to 18; the link gate 75 documents to 91 with three stale links repointed; scriptsLines, a new measure over the tooling; three uncalled test helpers gone. Four more blind gates deferred, each named with what it waits on | yes |
| (raised) e2e sessions seeding | T-0150 | proposed: `e2e-full` needs sessions only a Hermes-equipped machine has | no |
| (raised) the census reads twice | T-0152 | proposed: `routesWithSplitBlocks` read 1, then 2, then 1 on one unchanged tree | no |

**Three lines the next session should not have to learn the hard way.**

*Run the sweep, and read a survivor properly.* K4's sweep found two holes that
the gate, an independent review and a careful reading had all passed over: a
count with a floor loose enough to survive deleting the thing it guarded, and a
`.dockerignore` test that a commented-out rule still satisfied. K5's found three
more, and all three were the MUTANTS being wrong, not the oracle. A survivor is a
defect in one or the other, and saying which is the work.

*Do not amend your own frozen oracle.* K5's implementer did, on the one case
guarding the premise its ruling rested on, and the independent reviewer caught
it. The fix was to change the product prose so the oracle had nothing to amend
for. Q-015 sends an amendment to a session that is not you, and
`org/policy.json:107-111` makes it a stop condition.

*Never hand npm an argument with a newline in it.* npm re-spawns through
`cmd.exe /d /s /c`, which truncates any argument at its first newline. That is
`npx` and `npm run -- <arg>` alike, and it takes positionals as well as `-e`.
Measured here, three ways:

    node -e '<print argv>' $'X\nY'                 ->  ["X\nY"]   intact
    npx tsx -e '<print argv>' $'X\nY'              ->  ["X"]      TRUNCATED
    ./node_modules/.bin/tsx -e '<print argv>' $'X\nY'  ->  ["X\nY"]   intact

So node is innocent, tsx is innocent, and the Windows argv boundary is innocent:
a live process on this machine carries a 1,291-character `--eval` with thirty
newlines in it. It is npm's shell hop, and it fails SILENTLY at exit 0. On
2026-09-12 a session lost three hours to the blocking variant — the script was
cut to nothing, so node fell into a stdin REPL and waited forever — but the
quiet variant is worse: when the first line happens to be a complete statement
you get a partial run, exit 0, and an answer you will believe.

The repo already had the rule and it was not being followed:
`scripts/tooling/ps-deploy.mjs:205` says `node --import tsx <script.ts> [args]
→ argv-safe, no npm/npx/shell`. Ad-hoc probes go in a temp `.mjs`, or through
that form. This is the same lesson as "patch scripts go through the Write tool,
never a bash heredoc", one layer down.

**Phase 0 is done.** K0 to K6: the rulings, CI green, the discipline in the
repo, the security set, and the gates that can see. What follows is Phase 1, the
full recon (`org/reviews/2026-09-refactor-recon.md`), then Phase 2's plan, which
**the operator approves before any Phase 3 batch starts**.

Read the recon's brief in the plan before starting it, and note why the gates
came first: the recon and the plan are measured by them, so a census that could
not see `scripts/` would have set the next plan's targets against numbers that
were not true.

**One ruling is worth asking for.** T-0154's notes record it: `hooks-04`,
`hooks-05` and `critic-06` are blind gates deferred here not because of the
dependency this record first gave, but because none of the three has a ruled
entry in the register at all, and Q-015 permits amending a closed oracle only
for the one rule a RULED item fixes. `hooks-04` is the one to put to the
operator: register `:3144` says its fix may land "with a baseline and a c6
amendment (the same ruling as components-01)", and K6 already amends c6 and
already opens a design-lint baseline.

## The census, now against the plan's targets

| Measure | Plan start | Now | Target |

| jest | 6,860 | 6,920 (684 suites) | unchanged by a test batch |

## How a batch is landed (the discipline, verbatim from practice)

1. Write the oracle suite first, run it red, commit it red:
   `test: the CN oracle, red at X of Y, T-01xx`.
2. Implement. Patch scripts go through the Write tool, never a bash heredoc
   (heredocs on this box strip a backslash level; a `\b` became a backspace
   byte once).
3. Walk anything visual on the isolated instance:
   `PS_AUTH_TOKEN=u14walk PS_DATA_DIR=<a scratch dir> CH_DATA_DIR=<the same dir> PORT=3939 nohup npx next start -p 3939`
   (any empty directory outside the repo; the instance seeds it),
   visit `/?ps_token=u14walk` first, drive it with a Playwright script, stop
   the port. `npm run build` first if src changed.
4. The gate, by exit code, on the finished tree, with nothing edited while
   it runs: `npm run gate`. The runner frees the ports, clears `.next/dev`,
   stamps the tree before and after, runs the nine steps in order to their
   own logs, stops at the first red one and writes `.gate/summary.json`.
   The step list lives in `scripts/tooling/gate.mjs`, and
   `npm run gate -- --list` prints it, so no document restates it and none
   can drift from it. A Playwright spec that fails only under the gate's
   load is re-run with `npm run gate -- --rerun-alone <spec>`, and both
   results go on the record.
5. `git add -A` and the feat commit, with the gate's numbers in the message.
6. The mutation sweep against the COMMITTED tree:
   `npm run sweep -- tests/fixtures/mutants/T-01xx.json`. The mutants are
   committed beside the tests as data, so anyone can re-run the sweep. It
   refuses a dirty tree, and it reports NOT-APPLIED for an anchor it could
   not place exactly once and INEFFECTIVE for a no-op or comment-only edit,
   neither of which is a kill. A survivor gets the test it asks for as its
   own commit, then the sweep is re-run.
7. The record: `org/tasks/T-01xx.json` (intent, tier and reasons, claims,
   invariants, commits, verification with the numbers, mutation, deviation),
   then the views, from this repository's root with the EOS checkout on the
   path:

   ```
   PYTHONPATH=../PatterTech_EOS python -c "from tools.eos import taskops; print(taskops.render_views('.'))"
   ```

   then `node scripts/tooling/check-derived-views.mjs`,
   `node scripts/docs/build-site.mjs --manifest-only`, the chore commit,
   `git push origin dev`. The record names the EOS commit its views were
   rendered with.

8. **Read the pushed commit's CI, and do not start the next batch until it
   is green.** `gh run list --branch dev --limit 1`, then
   `gh run view <id> --log-failed` on anything red. This step exists because
   its absence cost six days: `dev` failed on all 61 pushes from 2026-09-05
   while about fifty records reported a green local gate, and two of the
   three causes could not be seen from Windows at all.
8. The line census: `--update-baseline` after a fall; a rise only with
   `--allow-growth "<reason>"`, and the reason is what the file keeps. The
   design-lint baseline works the same way. The output canary is
   re-blessed (`npm run canary:bless`) only for an intended change such as
   a new migration file, in the same commit.

Agents: a batch that touches many files in the same way is split into
disjoint file groups, one background agent each, with a written brief the
agent reads from disk; each agent runs its files before and after, proves
identity (test names through jest's JSON reporter, or the stripped-code
diff for a comment batch), and reports a table. The coordinator runs the
identity oracle, the census and the gate over the whole tree afterwards.

## Open items (none blocking)

- **C7, C8** remain; C7's starting notes are below.
- **Twelve design-lint pragmas** excuse the six C6 rules, each with its
  reason on the line (react-flow nodes, a code block inside rendered HTML,
  a range slider, a two-line list row, the chat composer's ref-focused
  textarea, a POST that reads, a debounced autosave, a warning callout, a
  pill that is a link). Three would go with small primitive changes:
  `Card` taking `role`/`style`/`data-*`, `Textarea` taking a `ref`, a
  warning tone on `LoadErrorBanner`.
- **The useGatewayHealth probes** lost their per-call 3s/5s abort deadlines
  when they moved onto `useApiResource` (apiFetch's default timeout applies).
- **Two design census measures rose**, with the reason written into the
  baseline: mono share 0.67 to 0.68 (the shared Button and Badge are mono by
  decision 10, and the batch adopted them widely) and decorative borders
  below 3:1 691 to 714 (Card's hairline rung is 1.63:1 on purpose). The
  measure that is a target, control borders below 3:1, fell 102 to 82.
- **Rows added as custom fallbacks before migration 042** read "Custom";
  their identity was never stored and cannot be recovered. The CHANGELOG
  says to add them again.
- **An eslint policy call** for the operator: every one-line factory
  adoption in tests pays an `eslint-disable-next-line
  @typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` for the hoisting-safe `require`
  inside `jest.mock`. A tests-scoped override of that rule would free about
  a hundred such lines. Not done, because it is a lint-policy change.
- **Two e2e specs flake only under the gate's load**: the composer spec's
  read after a save (now retries once on ECONNRESET, T-0139) and the help
  deep-link `?` shortcut on Missions (a two-second navigation window).
  Both pass alone every time; the record of each gate says so.
- **T-0140's fallback rows** on the isolated instance's data dir are walk
  artefacts, not product data.

## The programme is closed. What is next

The consolidation programme (C0 to C8, T-0135 to T-0145) is done and the plan
is marked done, with its own account of what met its target and what did not
in `org/plans/2026-09-consolidation.md` under "What the programme did". The
five misses are named there with their numbers and the reason each one is a
number rather than a failure.

Nothing in the programme is outstanding. What waits, in the operator's order:

1. **The v1.0.0 release.** The release actions have always been the
   operator's: the migration script on a copy of a real install, the Docker
   matrix, the tag. The checklist is in `docs/running/migration.md` and
   `org/plans/2026-09-final-release.md`. Nothing since has changed that order.
2. **The open items below**, none of which blocks a release.
3. **If another consolidation batch is wanted**, the honest remaining targets
   are the two line counts, and the census `--report` says where they are:
   `srcDup.byFile` and `testDup.byFile` name the files, `essays` the
   comment-heavy ones. The largest single item left is the missions page's
   handler lists, which are a prop-drilling shape rather than copied code, so
   the fix is a context or a hook object rather than a fold.

## Release

The v1.0.0 tag waits on the operator after the programmes; the release
actions (the migration script on a copy of a real install, the Docker
matrix, the tag) are in `docs/running/migration.md`'s release checklist and
`org/plans/2026-09-final-release.md`. Nothing here changes that order.
