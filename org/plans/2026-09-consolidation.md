## Progress

As of 2026-09-10: C0 to C5 landed and pushed (T-0135 to T-0138, T-0141,
T-0142), with the two fixes the walks found in between (T-0139, T-0140).
C6, C7 and C8 remain. The numbers against the targets, what is open and
how a batch is landed are in `org/HANDOVER.md`; each batch's own
corrections are written into its row below.

## What it is for

Three things, in the operator's words: development easier, maintenance
easier, structures more efficient. The line count is the measure, not the
goal: a line that is the only place a thing is decided is worth keeping, and
a line that is the fourth place the same thing is decided is the one to take
out. So every batch is named for the shape it makes one, and measured by a
census that counts the lines and the shapes and can only fall.

## What must survive

- **Every feature.** Decision 2 of the overhaul: a feature goes only with the
  operator's per-feature sign-off, and this plan proposes none.
- **The gates, unweakened.** `npm run lint` (twelve commands), `tsc`, jest,
  knip, canary, build, Playwright's two projects, the design census. A batch
  that needs a baseline re-cut re-cuts it downward.
- **The commentary culture.** A comment that names the defect a decision
  fixes stays (decision 9). What goes is narration of arithmetic.
- **The test corpus's questions.** The `it()` count and every coverage
  percentage are unchanged by a test batch (the U1 identity oracle).
- **The read contract, the status ladder, the primitive set, the registry,
  the single ring, the drawer.** Everything the overhaul held.

## The census that referees it

C0 adds `scripts/tooling/line-census.mjs` and its ratchet baseline
`scripts/tooling/line-census.baseline.json`, run by `npm run census:lines`,
counting on the tree:

| Measure | Key | Now | Target |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `src` lines | `srcLines` | 107,123 | **≤ 98,000** |
| `tests` lines | `testLines` | 121,651 | **≤ 116,000** |
| src lines in a repeated 6-line window | `srcRepeatedWindowLines` | 1,416 | **≤ 600** |
| tests lines in a repeated 6-line window | `testRepeatedWindowLines` | 6,028 | **≤ 2,500** |
| API routes with the try/serverErrorFromCatch body | `routesWithTryCatch` | 82 (126 sites) | **≤ 13** (a catch that does more than log, or a name that reads something other than the route's params, keeps its own; measured at C1) |
| files reading with useState + useEffect + safeApiCall | `handRolledReadHooks` | 5 | **0** |
| the four named action hooks without useApiMutation | `writeHooksWithoutMutation` | 4 | **0** |
| files spelling a repeated type shape (mission draft, model row, sync failure) | `repeatedTypeShapeFiles` | 23 | **3** |
| components with one importer | `oneImporterComponents` | 130 of 202 | **≤ 95** |
| files at the `src/lib` root | `libRootFiles` | 71 | **≤ 12** |
| src files ≥ 60 lines that are ≥ 40% comment | `commentEssays` | 107 | **≤ 60** |
| suites mocking `@/lib/db` inline | `suitesMockingDbInline` | 100 | **≤ 20** |
| design census: inline card chromes / raw controls / raw palette / arbitrary z | (design-lint baseline) | 222 / 24 / 77 / 20 | **≤ 120 / 0 / ≤ 30 / 0** |
| test count, coverage percentages | (jest) | 6,860 | **unchanged by a test batch; may grow with a source batch's oracles** |

The ratchet: a measure may fall and may not rise; `--allow-growth "<reason>"`
records the reason in the commit when one must.

## Batches

The per-batch discipline is the overhaul's, unchanged: one task record; the
oracle first, measured red; patch scripts through the Write tool and run
with `python`; the gate by exit code, with `npm run census:lines` added to
the chain; the isolated instance walked for anything a screen shows; a
mutation sweep against the committed tree; the record; the derived views;
the push. A sceptic reads `git diff` for deleted assertions after every
batch.

### C0 — The line census [S] · T-0135
- `scripts/tooling/line-census.mjs`: the measures above, the ratchet, the
  `--report` mode listing the elements behind each number, `--update-baseline`,
  `--root` and `--baseline` for a fixture tree.
- `npm run census:lines`, and the testing guide names both censuses.
- The recon filed under `org/reviews/`, this plan under `org/plans/`.
- Verify: the census refuses a planted growth and accepts a fall on a
  fixture tree; the baseline committed at today's numbers.

### C1 — One route body [M] · T-0136
- `route(name, doing, failed, handler)` in `src/lib/api/api-route.ts`: catches,
  logs through `serverErrorFromCatch` with the route's name, returns the
  handler's response; each of the three may be a function of the route's
  resolved params, so a dynamic segment's log keeps its id. The sites
  converted by an AST codemod: 112 handlers in 68 files; a catch that does
  more than log, or a name that reads something other than the params,
  keeps its own try (13 files).
- `requireAuth` stays where it is (three routes, the proxy does the rest).
- Verify: `routesWithTryCatch` 82 to 13; every API contract suite green
  unchanged; a mutant that swallows the error inside the wrapper is killed.

### C2 — One type each [S] · T-0137
- `MissionDraftFields` in `src/lib/missions/mission-types.ts`, imported by the
  nine; `ModelRow` beside the models repository for the seven; the sync
  source's failure result for the seven. Any other shape the census's window
  report shows three or more times.
- Verify: `tsc` proves the shapes were the same; `repeatedTypeShapeFiles` 23
  to 3.

### C3 — One way to write [L] · T-0138
- `useApiMutation(endpoint, opts)` beside `useApiResource`: react-query's
  `useMutation`, toast on failure through the feedback context, `refetch` of
  the named keys on success, `busy` while in flight, the optional two-step
  confirm. The four named action hooks onto it; the five hand-rolled reads
  onto `useApiResource`.
- `design-lint`'s `no-raw-fetch-in-component` extended to a write in a click
  handler that is not through the hook.
- Verify: `handRolledReadHooks` and `writeHooksWithoutMutation` to 0; the
  mission dispatch loop timed and unchanged; the model actions' contract
  suites green.
- Corrected in the batch (T-0138): the helper is a function, `runWrite` in
  `src/lib/api/api-write.ts`, not a hook, because the toast is per-page state
  (`useToast`) rather than a context and the reload is the caller's own
  loader; react-query's `useMutation` stays for the hooks that own query keys
  and invalidate them, and the lint rule (`no-raw-write-outside-the-helper`,
  a new rule beside the read rule) knows both. Four helpers and the
  `toastFromResult` idiom folded onto it, not one. The read measure, walked
  on the AST, found thirteen effect reads where the regex found five (three
  of those were click handlers); the two Story Weaver pages moved onto
  `useApiResource` and the eleven left are held on the census by name for
  C6 to take with the page layer.

### C4 — The test harnesses [L] · T-0141
- `tests/helpers/mocks.tsx` gains the db stanza (the dominant shape, opt-in
  per file), the paths stanza, the request stub; a `tests/helpers/story.tsx`
  harness for the seven story suites; the settings and models fixtures that
  the eight biggest suites each build.
- Verify: the identity oracle (`it()` count, coverage percentages unchanged);
  `testRepeatedWindowLines` and `suitesMockingDbInline`; knip clean.

### C5 — Comments that narrate [M] · T-0142
- File by file, the 107 essays: the extraction arithmetic, the byte-equivalence
  notes, the session numbers, the "used to" diaries that no longer name a
  defect. What stays is what says why.
- Verify: `commentEssays` 107 to ≤ 60; the operator reads the diff; no code
  line changes in this batch (a comment batch is comments).
- Corrected in the batch (T-0142): 104 essays at the start, not 107 (C3 and
  C4 had already cut three); 8 at the end, src 105,422 to 100,962. It took
  two passes, because the first left 73 essays against the 60: the files
  over forty percent comment were read again. The oracle counts design-lint
  pragma LINES rather than files, so one pragma cut among two in a file is
  seen. "No code line changes" is proved rather than promised: a
  stripped-code diff of every changed file against the batch base (171
  files, 0 code changes). Two stale facts were corrected rather than cut.

### C6 — The page layer [L] · T-0143
- One-importer components under sixty lines folded into their one caller
  where the fold reads better; siblings that are one thing merged; the 222
  inline card chromes onto `Card`, the 24 raw controls onto the primitives,
  the raw palette onto the ladder, the arbitrary z onto the scale.
- Verify: `oneImporterComponents`; the design census and design-lint
  baselines re-cut downward; the isolated instance walked at 1440 and 390;
  screenshots recaptured.
- Corrected in the batch (T-0143): the six rules went to ZERO, not down,
  and with them the whole design-lint baseline (369 to 0), with twelve
  pragmas whose reasons are on their lines. The batch also took the
  eleven effect reads C3 had held by name onto `useApiResource` (the
  census reads 0), the nineteen page-level writes onto `runWrite`, and
  fixed the body-swap-on-reload on Skills and Restore the way T-0139 fixed
  Models, each with its own behaviour test. Twenty-seven folds, not the
  twenty-five surveyed: `BrandMark` had one importer once the mobile
  header moved into the rail, and `QueryProvider` folded into
  `FeedbackProvider` because a server layout cannot hold a client. The
  one-importer count reads 103 against ≤ 95: every component under sixty
  lines is folded and the rest are larger, so the miss is recorded as a
  number for C8 unless C7 takes siblings. The census's index predicate was
  corrected (an index file is imported by its directory). Two gate floors
  moved with the tree: icon-only raw buttons 40 to 20 and raw controls 40
  to 15, because the primitives absorbed the population they counted.

### C7 — The lib root [M] · T-0144
- The 71 root files into their domains: `chat/`, `models/`, `schedules/`,
  `scripts/`, `credentials/`, `runs/`, `skills/`, `artifacts/`, with the
  repositories beside their types, the way T-0010 placed the first six.
  Moves, by script, with every import rewritten; the canary's module graph
  is path-insensitive.
- Verify: `libRootFiles` 71 to ≤ 12; `tsc`, knip, the reachability gate,
  `docs:check` and `check-doc-links`.
- Corrected in the batch (T-0144): 65 files moved into fifteen domains and
  six stayed, at 6 against the line of 12. The six are not leftovers: each
  says in its own header why it belongs to no domain, and `db-schema.ts` in
  particular must stay outside `src/lib/db/` because the global `@/lib/db`
  mock would otherwise intercept it inside the migration tests.
- The real lesson is that a lib file is named FIVE ways, and a codemod that
  rewrites one of them looks finished while four are broken: the alias
  `@/lib/x`; the path `src/lib/x.ts` in prose or a doc; the segments
  `"src", "lib", "x.ts"` a suite passes to `join()`; the relative
  `../../src/lib/x` that scripts/ and tests/e2e/ use because the alias does
  not reach them; and the alias escaped inside a regex literal. Each was
  found by something breaking, in that order, and the oracle now reads all
  five. A sixth shape has no mechanical fix and is recorded rather than
  solved: a path ALTERNATION inside a regex, which makes a `not.toMatch`
  pass vacuously the moment the path stops existing.

### C8 — Closing [S] · T-0145
- The census after beside the census before, each measure read against its
  target, the missed ones as numbers. The docs that name a moved path
  updated. The plan marked done.

## What the programme did

Closed at C8 (T-0145) on 2026-09-11. Twelve measures, eight batches, two
fixes the walks found on the way, 39 commits on `dev`, every batch gated by
exit code and swept for mutants against its own committed tree.

Seven of the twelve met their target and five did not. The misses are here
with their numbers, because a target quietly restated to match what was
achieved would make the whole census worthless.

| Measure | C0 | Now | Target | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `srcLines` | 107,123 | 100,881 | 98,000 | missed by 2,881 |
| `testLines` | 121,762 | 121,114 | 116,000 | missed by 5,114 |
| `srcRepeatedWindowLines` | 1,416 | 1,000 | 600 | missed by 400 |
| `testRepeatedWindowLines` | 6,028 | 4,343 | 2,500 | missed by 1,843 |
| `routesWithTryCatch` | 82 | 13 | 13 | met (C1) |
| `handRolledReadHooks` | 5 | 0 | 0 | met (C6) |
| `writeHooksWithoutMutation` | 4 | 0 | 0 | met (C3) |
| `repeatedTypeShapeFiles` | 23 | 2 | 3 | met (C2) |
| `oneImporterComponents` | 130 | 103 | 95 | missed by 8 |
| `libRootFiles` | 71 | 6 | 12 | met (C7) |
| `commentEssays` | 107 | 9 | 60 | met (C5) |
| `suitesMockingDbInline` | 100 | 14 | 20 | met (C4) |

Beside them, the debt the UI overhaul left as a baseline: design-lint 369
violations to **0**, with twelve pragmas whose reasons are on their lines
(C6). The design census fell too: card chromes 63 to 54, button chromes 56 to
45, border colours 28 to 24, box shadows 10 to 8, control borders below 3:1
102 to 82.

### Why the five missed, in the words of the measures themselves

**The two line counts.** The programme cut 6,242 lines from `src` and 648
from `tests`, against targets asking for 9,123 and 5,762. The estimate came
from the recon's duplication ceiling, and the ceiling counted every repeated
window as removable. It is not: a window repeated by exactly two consumers
cannot pay for its own interface. C8 measured this directly on the Rec Room
library panels, where folding 48 duplicated lines cost 39 new ones for the
shared component and its two prop types. What the programme actually removed
is the duplication with three or more consumers, and it removed nearly all of
it.

`tests` moved least because C4's rule was identity: the same test count, the
same coverage, or the saving is not a saving. Sixteen suites keep their own
database stanza after C8, and each is a fixture that differs in what it
admits (foreign keys off, an on-disk file, a schema deliberately older than
the baseline). Adopting a helper there would change what the harness allows,
which is a behaviour change wearing a refactor's clothes.

**The two repeated-window counts.** Both more than halved. What is left is
mostly import stanzas, which a helper cannot remove without hiding what a
file depends on, and prop lists, which are an interface written once at each
end.

**One-importer components.** Every component under sixty lines is folded, 27
of them, and the 103 that remain are larger pieces with a real subject or
index re-exports. The plan's own decision 5 says the target was the wrappers
that say nothing, not a page split into named parts; by that reading the
work is done and the number is simply the wrong instrument for it. C8 leaves
it as a number rather than folding pages into each other to move it.

### What the programme is leaving behind

- One route body, one write helper, one read hook, one type per shape, one
  test double per stanza, one domain per lib file.
- Six gates that did not exist at C0 or that now read zero: the line census
  itself, design-lint's whole baseline, the write rule, the read rule, the
  lib-root oracle and the programme's own arithmetic (this file, held by
  `tests/unit/c8-the-programme-is-closed.test.ts`).
- Two product defects the walks found and fixed on the way: the Models page
  swapping its body for a spinner on every reload (T-0139), and a custom
  fallback losing the name, provider and model id an operator typed
  (T-0140, migration 042).

## What I decided not to do, and why

1. **Not merge test files by subject.** Decision 11: it moves lines rather
   than deleting them, and the suites are the record.
2. **Not delete the comment that names a defect.** The good components are
   good because of them.
3. **Not shorten the API surface.** Three orphan routes went in U15; the rest
   have callers, and `api.md` documents them.
4. **Not introduce a framework** (an ORM, a form library, a state library).
   Each is a second way beside the one being made single.
5. **Not chase the one-importer count to zero.** A page split into named
   pieces is structure; the target is the wrappers that say nothing.

## Risks and how each is held

- **A codemod that changes behaviour.** Every batch's oracle is the contract
  suite that already exists, plus the census; the sweep proves the new shape
  is load-bearing.
- **The comment batch is judgement.** No regex; the diff is the deliverable
  the operator reads, and a comment in doubt stays.
- **Moves break a path a doc names.** `check-doc-links` and the canary's
  route/module surfaces catch it; C7 runs `docs:check`.
- **The identity oracle for tests.** A coverage percentage that moves is a
  defect, not a saving.
