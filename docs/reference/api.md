# API Reference

Dry reference for REST routes: envelope shape, inventory, auth notes. For behaviour in plain language, see [USER_WALKTHROUGH_GUIDE.md](../README.md) or the feature docs linked from [README.md](../README.md).

All JSON API routes return the envelope:

```typescript
{ data?: T; error?: string }
```

Some error responses also include `details` (Zod validation). Handlers must call `logApiError(route, context, error)` from `@/lib/api/api-logger` in catch blocks.

Six routes deliberately sit outside the envelope, and a client integrator should special-case them:

- `/api/health` returns a bare `{ ok: true }` (no `data` wrapper) because it is the one unauthenticated JSON route and must stay trivially parseable by a container probe.
- `/healthz` returns a plain-text `ok` (200, `text/plain`, `no-store`) — the bare liveness probe. It is unauthenticated and carries no JSON, no version info, and no system state. Use it for uptime checks and load-balancer probes; for anything describing real state, use `/api/status`.
- The three SSE routes (`/api/runs/[id]/events`, `/api/composer/runs/[id]/events`, `/api/laboratory/research/[id]/events`) return a `text/event-stream` body, and their pre-stream errors are plain text, not JSON.
- `/api/laboratory/research/[id]/export` returns raw HTML with a `Content-Disposition` header.

## Route inventory

Every `route.ts` under `src/app/api` has a row, here or in the Chat / Composer / Laboratory tables that follow. A route absent from all four does not exist.

| Route | Methods | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/agent/files/[key]` | `GET`, `PUT` | Read/update one behavior file (`soul`, `hermes`, `user`, `memory`, `agent`, `env`, `config`). Any other key is a **400** (`Unknown file key`). Optional `?profile=` for non-default profiles. `PUT hermes` on a named profile is a **400**: HERMES.md exists only on the root agent. |
| `/api/agent/root` | `GET`, `PUT` | The root agent's PatterStage-side label. `PUT { displayName?, description? }` renames it; a blank name is a **400**, and nothing is written into the agent's own files. `POST` is a **405**. |
| `/api/agent/profiles` | `GET`, `POST` | Professional profiles (SQLite source of truth; each row includes `syncStatus` for drift). `POST { cloneFrom: "default" }` copies the root agent's SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, config.yaml and personality. |
| `/api/agent/profiles/[id]` | `PUT`, `DELETE` | Update or delete one profile (no `GET`, use list + id). |
| `/api/agent/profiles/sync/push` | `POST` | Push to `HERMES_HOME/profiles/<slug>/`. Body is a bag of optional flags, first match wins: `{ root }`, `{ skills }`, `{ skillKey }`, `{ all }` / `{ missingOnly }` / `{ onlyOutOfSync }`, else `{ slug }`. |
| `/api/agent/profiles/sync/pull` | `POST` | Pull from Hermes disk into the DB. Same flag-bag shape: `{ skills }`, `{ skillKey }`, `{ all }` / `{ importDiscovered }`, `{ root }` (or `slug: "default"`), else `{ slug }`. Supplying none of them is a **400** (`slug, all, root, or skills required`). |
| `/api/agent/profiles/sync/import` | `GET`, `POST` | `GET` lists profiles discovered on Hermes disk (each with an `inDatabase` flag); `POST` imports them into the DB (`{ importSkills }`, `{ importAllDiscovered }`, or `{ slug }`). |
| `/api/agents` | `GET` | Inspect running Hermes agent processes (OS-dependent). Not the same as `agent/profiles`. |
| `/api/agents/experience` | `GET` | Every profile's accumulated Agent Experience, ranked. Derived from completed runs, active days, enabled skills, attached toolsets and memory facts. The surviving half of the deleted benchmark subsystem (ADR-0004): no capability claim, only what the agent actually did or was given. |
| `/api/config` | `GET`, `PUT` | Read/update parsed Hermes config content. `GET` masks every `api_key` and, when the file did not parse, carries `configError` beside the (empty) payload. `PUT` answers **400** when a value breaks its declared type, option list or min/max, and a `null` value deletes the key so Hermes falls back to its own default; the write refreshes `agent_root.config_yaml` so a later Push cannot revert it. |
| `/api/credentials` | `GET`, `POST` | API key credentials (masked list; create via POST). |
| `/api/credentials/[id]` | `PATCH`, `DELETE` | `PATCH { apiKey }` rotates the stored key and rewrites the provider's Hermes `.env` variable; a failed `.env` write puts the old key back and answers **500**. `DELETE` removes the credential: its `.env` variable goes with it unless a same-provider sibling still uses it, and the models that pointed at it are unlinked; the answer says which happened. `GET` returns **405**. |
| `/api/cron/hardware` | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | Host **scripts** (system cron) under `PS_SCRIPTS_DIR` / `PS_HARDWARE_LOG_DIR`, powering the Scripts page. (The legacy `/api/cron` agent-cron bridge has been removed; recurring agent work uses `/api/schedules`.) |
| `/api/scripts` | `GET` | List host script files under `PS_DATA_DIR/scripts` with each file's schedule, where that schedule lives (`scheduleSource`: `host` or `patterstage`) and last-run hint, plus `scheduler: { available, reason }` saying whether this host schedules without PatterStage. |
| `/api/scripts/[name]` | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | Read, upsert (`{ content }`) or delete one host script. Path-validated under `PS_DATA_DIR/scripts`; powers the in-app editor. |
| `/api/scripts/run` | `POST` | Run a script on demand (`{ name }`). Path-validated, no shell. Answers `{ outcome: "succeeded" \| "failed", exitCode }` when the script ran, 404 when there is no such script, and 503 naming the reason when the machine could not start it. |
| `/api/scripts/logs` | `GET` | Tail a script's log (`?name=&lines=`). |
| `/api/schedules` | `GET`, `POST` | PatterStage-owned recurring work (the scheduler fires these; no `jobs.json`). `POST` takes `kind`: a `mission` row needs `missionId`, a `script` row needs `scriptName`, and each is refused by name if its own id is missing. |
| `/api/schedules/[id]` | `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` | Read one schedule (404 when missing), pause/resume or edit it (`enabled`, `name`, `schedule`, `scheduleDisplay`, `catchUpPolicy`, `repeatTimes`, `profileName`), or delete it. |
| `/api/schedules/[id]/run` | `POST` | Dispatch a scheduled mission immediately (run-now). |
| `/api/stats` | `GET` | Dashboard analytics aggregate (throughput, mission mix, run activity, tokens, per-agent performance, derived progression + the ~36 achievements). Also appends a per-agent progression snapshot when an agent's recorded level or unlocked set has moved. |
| `/api/agents/progression` | `GET` | The **recorded** per-agent growth, from the append-only `agent_progression_snapshots` table: newest row per profile, or one profile's whole trail with `?slug=`. Survives the retention prune of the events it was derived from (see [MIGRATION.md](../running/migration.md)). |
| `/api/analytics` | `GET` | Interaction analytics summary (`{ totals, last30, activeDays }`) over the `analytics_events` log. Read-only: events are server-emitted, so there is no `POST`. See [ANALYTICS.md](../guides/insights.md). |
| `/api/analytics/timeseries` | `GET` | Gap-filled daily event counts (`?type=&days=&bucket=day`; `days` clamped 1, 365). |
| `/api/analytics/insights` | `GET` | Composed bundle for the Insights workbench (`?days=`, default 30): hour-of-day, per-category daily, run-duration distribution, per-model tokens/cost, top missions, success-rate trend. |
| `/api/spend` | `GET`, `PUT` | Provider spend per calendar period and per source, plus the operator's **optional** budget and the verdict against it. `PUT` sets `limitUsd` (positive number, or `null` to remove the budget), `period` (`day`/`week`/`month`) and `hardStop`. Arming `hardStop` without a figure is a 400. See [SPEND.md](spend.md). |
| `/api/fs/git/branches` | `GET` | List git branches for a workspace path. |
| `/api/fs/list` | `GET` | List directory entries (path-validated). |
| `/api/gateway/health` | `GET` | Gateway probe → `{ online, authConfigured }`. Any HTTP response (incl. 401/403) ⇒ reachable; 401/403 ⇒ reachable but the `API_SERVER_KEY` is missing/wrong. |
| `/api/gateway/models` | `GET` | List models from gateway. |
| `/api/logs` | `GET`, `DELETE` | Read recent Hermes logs; clear/truncate log tail. |
| `/api/memory` | `GET` | Memory **provider status**, not facts: `{ facts, total, dbSize, available, provider, message }`, with `facts` empty on every branch. Facts are managed by agent tools (`hindsight_retain` / `_recall` / `_reflect`), never by the dashboard, so `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` are all bound to one handler that returns **400** for every provider. |
| `/api/memory/config` | `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` | The PatterStage-owned memory provider config. `GET` lists providers + the active connection; `PUT` updates a provider's host/port/bank (and enable/activate), and on an activation also writes `memory.provider` into the agent's `config.yaml`, answering `{ provider, configYaml }` where `configYaml` reports whether the file was written and why not; `POST { action: "test", type, config }` probes an endpoint before saving and answers `{ health }`. See [MEMORY.md](../guides/memory.md). |
| `/api/memory/hindsight` | `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` | Hindsight bridge (see [Hindsight actions](#hindsight-actions) below). |
| `/api/mission-categories` | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | Mission category CRUD (see [MISSIONS.md](../guides/missions.md)). |
| `/api/missions` | `GET`, `POST` | Mission list/detail + RPC mutations (see [RPC-style routes](#rpc-style-routes)). |
| `/api/missions/[id]` | `GET` | One mission, for REST symmetry with the sub-routes below. The list endpoint also accepts `?id=`. |
| `/api/missions/[id]/cancel` | `POST` | Stop a running mission via `runtime.stopRun`. Local run/mission/session state is finalised even if the backend call fails. |
| `/api/missions/[id]/run` | `GET` | The mission's latest run, so the board can resolve a PatterStage run id and stream `/api/runs/[id]/events`. |
| `/api/models` | `GET`, `POST` | Models registry (SQLite). |
| `/api/models/[id]` | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | One model row. |
| `/api/models/[id]/diff` | `POST` | Diff model row vs Hermes config. |
| `/api/models/defaults` | `GET`, `PUT` | Default model per task slot. |
| `/api/models/fallbacks` | `GET`, `POST` | `GET` lists the chain + config; `POST` is an `action`-discriminated mutation (`add` \| `toggle` \| `reorder` \| `custom` \| `import` \| `sync`). |
| `/api/models/fallbacks/[id]` | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | One fallback entry. |
| `/api/models/fallbacks/config` | `GET`, `PUT` | Fallback chain behaviour config. |
| `/api/models/import` | `GET`, `POST` | `GET` preview; `POST` import from Hermes config. |
| `/api/models/sync/drift` | `GET` | Model drift between DB and Hermes. |
| `/api/models/sync/pull` | `POST` | Pull models from Hermes into DB. |
| `/api/models/sync/push` | `POST` | Push models from DB to Hermes. |
| `/api/monitor` | `GET` | Aggregated dashboard snapshot (cron, sessions, gateway, sync, errors). |
| `/api/orchestration/chat` | `POST` | Proxy chat to Hermes gateway. |
| `/api/runs/[id]` | `GET` | Current state of one agent run. |
| `/api/runs/[id]/events` | `GET` | Live **SSE** proxy for a run (`text/event-stream`). 404 when the run is unknown, 409 before it has been submitted to the backend. The Chat page and the mission board both stream from here. |
| `/api/runs/reconcile` | `POST` | Force an immediate reconcile pass over active runs, rather than waiting for the ~15s BackgroundScheduler tick. Idempotent. |
| `/api/seed` | `GET`, `POST` | `GET` answers `{ state, pack }`, where `pack` counts what the shipped starter set contains, read from disk. `POST` restores; `mode: "replace"` takes a `pre-restore` database snapshot first and refuses outright if it cannot, and the answer carries `imported` and `backup`. |
| `/api/seed/clean` | `GET`, `POST` | `GET` previews the throwaway test data a purge would remove; `POST` takes a `pre-clean` database snapshot, purges, writes an audit line, and answers `{ removed, counts, backup }`. |
| `/api/sessions` | `GET` | List sessions. Query: `source` (any value the column holds, not only the named ones), `status` (`active`, `completed`, `failed`), `hideApiNoise=1` (drop api sessions under 1KB that lived under a minute, in SQL), `missionId`, `search`, `limit` (max 100), `offset`. Answers `{ sessions, total, totals, sources }`, where `sources` is every source the same filter can still reach. |
| `/api/sessions/[id]` | `GET` | Read one session transcript. Carries `status`, `exitCode`, `error`, and `truncated` when only the newest `MAX_SESSION_MESSAGES` messages were loaded. |
| `/api/admin/sessions/backfill-status` | `POST` | One-shot orphan-close sweep over stuck session rows, running the same logic as the recurring 15s sync as an explicit operator action. `{ dryRun: true }` (the default) returns the counts that *would* change. See [MISSIONS.md](../guides/missions.md). |
| `/api/skills` | `GET` | List skills inventory. |
| `/api/skills/[name]` | `GET`, `PUT` | Read or update one skill document. |
| `/api/skills/[name]/toggle` | `PUT` | Enable/disable a skill for a profile. |
| `/api/skills/[...path]` | `GET` | Read files under a skill tree (`SKILL.md`, etc.). |
| `/api/status` | `GET` | Basic readiness endpoint, read from the `meta` table. Requires auth. |
| `/api/status/subsystems` | `GET` | The dashboard's Subsystems panel: gateway (with its URL), memory, scheduler and database, each with a state and the reason for it. |
| `/api/status/runtime` | `GET` | How this install is configured, as data: auth mode, whether the deploy API and read-only are on, the composer flag, data directory, database path, Hermes home, port, schema version, app version, commit, gateway address, Node and platform. No secrets: it says whether the token mode is on, never what the token is. Backs Settings > System and its "Copy for a bug report". |
| `/api/backup` | `GET`, `POST` | `GET` lists the database backups newest first (`{ dbPath, dir, backups: [{ name, path, bytes, takenAt, kind }], restoreCommand }`): the snapshots under `PS_DATA_DIR/backups/db` (or `PS_DB_BACKUP_DIR`) plus the `pre-migrate` and `pre-baseline` files beside the database. It creates nothing, and read-only can still read it. `POST` takes one with better-sqlite3's online backup, which is consistent under WAL, and answers **201** `{ backup }`; read-only refuses it. The same snapshot runs before a replace-mode Restore and before a test-data purge. Restoring is a shell step the operator runs with the server stopped; `restoreCommand` is that command, and nothing here executes it. Backs the Backups card on Settings > System. |
| `/api/prefs` | `GET`, `PUT` | The console's own settings for this operator (`{ prefs }`): the rail collapsed, the dispatch strip open, quests completed or skipped, the guide hidden, the last help page. `PUT` `{ key, value }` against a Zod allow-list of six keys; an unknown key or a wrong shape is **400**, and read-only refuses it. |
| `/api/health` | `GET` | The one **unauthenticated** JSON route (the `PUBLIC_PATHS` allow-list in `src/proxy.ts`). Returns a bare `{ ok: true }` and deliberately reports nothing about the system, so a container probe never needs the access token. Anything describing real state belongs on `/api/status`. |
| `/api/healthz` | `GET` | Unauthenticated JSON alias of `/api/health` (`{ ok: true }`), in `PUBLIC_PATHS`. Only `GET`/`HEAD` pass the proxy; other methods get 401. |
| `/healthz` | `GET` | Bare **liveness probe**: plain-text `ok` (200, `text/plain`, `cache-control: no-store`). Unauthenticated (`PUBLIC_PATHS`), no JSON, no DB, no version/config info. The lightest endpoint a load balancer or uptime monitor can hit. |
| `/api/feature-flags` | `GET` | Current feature-flag state (`{ flags }`), so client components can hide disabled surfaces without a rebuild. Flags default ON; today the only flag is `composer`. |
| `/api/stories` | `POST` | Story Weaver: all operations via `action` (see [RPC-style routes](#rpc-style-routes)). |
| `/api/sync` | `GET`, `POST` | Background sync control and status. |
| `/api/templates` | `GET`, `POST` | Mission templates; mutations via `action` on `POST`. |
| `/api/tools` | `GET` | Read-only Hermes toolset ID catalog. `POST` returns **405** (writes not supported). |
| `/api/agent/profiles/[id]/toolsets` | `GET`, `PUT` | Read or update `platform_toolsets` for a profile (`default` = agent root). `GET` hydrates from DB → yaml → seed and may persist normalized JSON. `PUT` saves and pushes to Hermes disk. `DELETE` returns **405**. |
| `/api/update` | `GET`, `POST` | Deploy: compare branches, branch list, deploy status; `POST` `restart` \| `rebuild` \| `update`. `POST` is gated by `PS_ENABLE_DEPLOY_API` (see [Auth and safety notes](#auth-and-safety-notes)); both `GET` answers carry `deployEnabled` so the footer can say so before the click, and a compare that could not be made says `checkFailed: true` rather than "up to date". |

### Chat

Agent conversations. See [CHAT.md](../guides/chat.md).

| Route | Methods | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/chat` | `GET`, `POST` | List conversations (most recent first); create one, mapped to a fresh Hermes session (`{ title?, profileName?, model? }`). |
| `/api/chat/[id]` | `GET`, `DELETE` | Read `{ conversation, messages }`, self-healing any stuck assistant turn on the way out; or delete the conversation and cascade its messages. |
| `/api/chat/[id]/messages` | `POST` | Send a user turn (`{ content, mode? }`). `mode: "agent"` (the default) submits a run and returns the PatterStage `runId` to stream from `/api/runs/[runId]/events`; `mode: "fast"` persists the turn and an assistant placeholder with no run behind it, and the client streams the raw-model reply itself. |
| `/api/chat/[id]/messages/[messageId]` | `PATCH` | Finalize a streamed turn: content, reasoning, tool calls, terminal status. The fast path, not the only path, since `GET /api/chat/[id]` also heals from the run row. |
| `/api/chat/[id]/stop` | `POST` | Stop the conversation's in-flight run (`{ runId? }`, defaulting to the latest active assistant turn) and finalize it as cancelled. A turn with no run returns `{ stopped: false, reason: "no active run" }`. |
| `/api/chat/[id]/approval` | `POST` | Resolve a tool-use approval gate (`{ runId, approved, note? }`) via `runtime.resolveApproval`. |

### Composer

Graph orchestration. Every route below, the SSE stream included, returns **503** when `PS_COMPOSER` is falsy. See [COMPOSER.md](../guides/composer.md).

| Route | Methods | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/composer/workflows` | `GET`, `POST` | List workflow definitions; create one from a whole-graph definition. |
| `/api/composer/workflows/[id]` | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | Read, replace or delete one workflow. `PUT` and `DELETE` answer **409** with `{ runCount, workflowName, confirmWith }` when the change would destroy completed runs; repeat with `?discardRunHistory=1` to go ahead. An absent `description` on a `PUT` leaves the stored one alone; `""` clears it. |
| `/api/composer/runs` | `GET`, `POST` | List recent runs; start one (`{ workflowId \| workflowKey, input }`) and kick the engine so the first stage dispatches immediately. |
| `/api/composer/runs/[id]` | `GET` | One run + its node-runs + the workflow graph. Answers `{ run, nodeRuns, graph, approvals }`. |
| `/api/composer/runs/[id]/events` | `GET` | Live **SSE** (`{ run, nodeRuns }` snapshots), closing when the run is terminal. |
| `/api/composer/runs/[id]/cancel` | `POST` | Cancel a run: the run and its live node-runs are marked cancelled and their backend runs are stopped. |
| `/api/composer/runs/[id]/nodes/[nodeId]/approve` | `POST` | Resolve a human-in-the-loop gate (`accept` \| `reject`) and advance the graph. |
| `/api/composer/runs/[id]/clarify` | `POST` | Answer a stage's clarification question (`{ answer }`); the answer enriches the objective and re-dispatches the asking stage. |

### Laboratory

Deep Research and the artifacts registry. See [LABORATORY.md](../guides/research.md) and [DEEP_RESEARCH.md](../guides/research.md).

| Route | Methods | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/laboratory/research` | `GET`, `POST` | List recent research runs; start one (`{ query, config? }`), which creates the row and fires the engine as fire-and-forget. |
| `/api/laboratory/research/[id]` | `GET` | One research run + its steps. |
| `/api/laboratory/research/[id]/cancel` | `POST` | Stop a run in flight. `404` unknown id, `409` a run that already finished; otherwise the cancelled run. The job bails out rather than overwriting the row. |
| `/api/laboratory/research/[id]/events` | `GET` | Live **SSE** (`{ run, steps }` snapshots), closing when the run is terminal. |
| `/api/laboratory/research/[id]/export` | `GET` | The standalone interactive HTML report. Raw `text/html` with a `Content-Disposition: inline` header, not the JSON envelope. |
| `/api/laboratory/research/presets` | `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` | Saved Deep Research configurations; `DELETE` takes `?id=`. |
| `/api/artifacts` | `GET`, `POST` | The artifacts registry. `GET` lists, filterable by `?kind=` and `?runId=`; `POST` creates one, with `sourceKind` one of `research`, `composer`, `mission`, `chat`, `manual` (default `manual`). |
| `/api/artifacts/[id]` | `GET`, `DELETE` | Read one artifact with its content, or delete it. |

## Drift and sync

| Resource | How drift is exposed | Sync routes |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Models** | `GET /api/models/sync/drift` | `POST .../pull`, `POST .../push` |
| **Profiles** | `syncStatus` on each row from `GET /api/agent/profiles`, which is what the drift banner and the per-row badge read (the separate full-report route had no caller and was removed in T-0129) | `POST /api/agent/profiles/sync/push`, `POST .../pull` |

## RPC-style routes

Several routes use **GET for reads** and **POST with an `action` field** for mutations (not HTTP `PUT`/`DELETE` on the same path).

### `/api/missions`: `POST` body `action`

Each action body lives in its own handler under `src/lib/missions/mission-handlers/*` behind a thin router in the route.

| `action` | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `dispatch` | Create a mission and run it per `dispatchMode` (`save` draft / `queue` / `cron` recurring schedule / immediate) |
| `promote` | Promote a draft or queued-waiting mission per `dispatchMode` |
| `update` | Update fields of a **running** mission / rebuild prompt |
| `cancel` | Stop the backend run; mark failed with "Cancelled by user" |
| `delete` | Remove the mission and its linked PatterStage schedule |

`GET` supports `?id=` for one mission (status synced in background) or list with optional `?categoryId=`.

### `/api/models/fallbacks`: `POST` body `action`

| `action` | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `add` | Add a registry model to the fallback chain |
| `toggle` | Enable/disable one entry (`entryId`, `enabled`) |
| `reorder` | Swap an entry up/down (`entryId`, `direction`) |
| `custom` | Add a custom (non-registry) fallback (`name`, `provider`, `modelIdString`, `baseUrl?`) |
| `import` | Import the chain from Hermes `config.yaml` |
| `sync` | Write the enabled chain + behaviour config to Hermes |

`GET` returns the chain entries + behaviour config. Per-entry `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` live at `/api/models/fallbacks/[id]`; the behaviour config at `/api/models/fallbacks/config`.

### `/api/templates`: `POST` body `action`

| `action` | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `create` | New template |
| `update` | Update template |
| `delete` | Delete template |
| `importPack` | Import template pack JSON |

`GET` lists templates (cached).

### `/api/stories`: `POST` body `action`

| `action` | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `create` | New story |
| `list` | List stories |
| `load` | Load one story |
| `update` | Update metadata/config |
| `delete` | Delete story |
| `generate-chapter` | Generate chapter content |
| `retry-chapter` | Retry failed chapter |
| `rewrite-chapter` | Rewrite chapter |
| `edit-chapter` | Edit chapter text |
| `extend` | Extend outline |
| `continue` | Continue generation |
| `sync-titles` | Sync chapter titles |
| `characters` | The reusable character library. Takes a `subAction` of its own (`list` (default) \| `create` \| `update` \| `delete`). |
| `themes` | The reusable theme library, same `subAction` set. |

### `/api/sessions`: `POST` body `action`

| `action` | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `create` | Pre-register session (dispatch pipeline) |
| `update` | Update session status / end time |

### Hindsight actions

**`GET /api/memory/hindsight`**, query param `action` (default `list`):

`list`, `recall`, `reflect`, `directives`, `mental-models`, `health`, `count`

**`POST /api/memory/hindsight`**, body `action` (default `retain`):

`retain`, `create-directive`, `create-model`, `update-directive`, `update-model`, `refresh-model`

**`DELETE /api/memory/hindsight`** with body `{ type, id, bank? }` removes a directive or mental model.

## Naming notes

- **`/api/agent/*`**: Hermes install config (profiles, the root agent's label, behavior files).
- **`/api/agents`**: Running OS processes (gateways, `hermes chat`), not profile CRUD.
- **Personality**: a profile’s voice lives in its SOUL.md, so it is written through `PUT /api/agent/files/soul?profile=<slug>` and read back on `GET /api/agent/profiles`. The two routes that used to answer for it were retired with the Personalities page (decision 11, T-0103).

## System cron notes

Managed crontab lines must run a script **under** `scriptsDir` (default `PS_DATA_DIR/scripts`). `POST`/`PUT` reject any other command path. Preset scripts ship in repo **`scripts/hardware/`**; **`scripts/bootstrap/setup.sh`** copies any missing `*.sh` into `PS_DATA_DIR/scripts` during setup. See **[SYSTEM-CRON.md](../running/host-scheduling.md)**.

## Auth and safety notes

- **`PS_READ_ONLY`** rejects unsafe HTTP **methods** with a 503, in `src/proxy.ts`, before any handler runs. Reads keep working, which is the point of the mode. It applies to every route uniformly by method. Three reads do bookkeeping writes of their own on every poll (the `/api/stats` progression capture, the toolsets normalisation, the `/api/sessions` state.db sync); each skips that write under the mode and still answers, and the linter that forbids a read-only guard in a GET accepts exactly those three, each with its reason on the line above.
- The refusal happens **after** authentication, so an unauthenticated write gets a 401 rather than learning whether the instance is read-only.
- Routes used to carry their own `requireAuth()` guard. It authenticated nothing, and because 34 GET handlers called it the mode blanked the dashboard it exists to enable. It was deleted in T-0048; `scripts/tooling/check-read-only-guards.mjs` fails the build if one comes back.
- Deploy actions (`POST /api/update`) require `PS_ENABLE_DEPLOY_API`. Setup writes it `true` on a fresh install (only when absent, so a choice survives a re-run); set it `0`/`false`/`no` to close the route, and the sidebar block says so before the click. Unset, the gate falls back to `NODE_ENV !== "production"`, so an install that predates setup writing it is *enabled* under `npm run dev` and closed under `npm run start`.
- **Host-affecting writes** (`POST /api/scripts/run`, `PUT`/`DELETE /api/scripts/[name]`, `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/cron/hardware`, `POST /api/update`) return **403** while `PS_AUTH_MODE=none`. Writing a script that a crontab will later execute, running one, or spawning the deploy script is unauthenticated RCE once the token is switched off; with the token on, the operator already has shell access to that host, so it is a feature. The proxy refuses these from a list of paths before any handler runs, and the routes carry the same guard themselves.
- The two notes below are **`POST /api/update` only**, not API-wide. Nothing else calls these helpers, so setting the secret or sending the headers hardens no other route.
- Optional signed requests: `PS_REQUEST_SIGNING_SECRET`, with `x-ps-ts` + `x-ps-signature` headers over `METHOD:path:ts` and a 5-minute window. Unset means unsigned requests pass.
- **The signature does not cover the request body,** and there is no nonce. Two posts to the same path within the window verify against the same signature whatever they carry, so a captured signed request can be replayed with another action or another branch: `update` in place of `restart`, or a branch you did not ask for. The gap is recorded rather than closed because anyone able to capture the request already holds the token, and the token alone can save a script and run it (`PUT`/`POST /api/scripts/*`), which is strictly more than a replay buys.
- **Setting the secret turns off the in-app deploy buttons.** Update, Rebuild and Restart post from `src/hooks/useVersionFooter.ts`, which sends no signature, so with the secret set they answer **401 `Missing signature headers`**. Set it only if you drive `POST /api/update` from your own signed client.
- Correlation IDs: `x-correlation-id` or `x-request-id`; a UUID is generated when neither is sent.
