/**
 * C5 · Comments that narrate.
 *
 * A quarter of src was comment, and 104 files of sixty lines or more were
 * forty percent comment or more. Some of that is the culture the overhaul
 * kept on purpose (a comment that names the defect a decision fixes); the
 * rest narrated the extraction arithmetic, the byte-equivalence of a move,
 * the session it happened in, and what the code used to be. Read file by
 * file, never cut by regex (T-0142); what stays is what says why.
 *
 * This suite holds the outcome: the narration markers are gone from
 * comments, the census's essay count is under the plan's line, and the
 * pragmas the gates read are all still there. The batch's other rule, that
 * not one code line moved, is checked against git at the gate by
 * scratchpad/c5/verify-comments-only.mjs and recorded.
