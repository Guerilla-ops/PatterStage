/**
 * U17 · The phone keeps its title.
 *
 * The header's actions and its title share one flex row, and the title group
 * grows into what the actions leave. On a phone the busiest headers leave
 * nothing: Chat's mode toggle and New Chat, Scripts' two buttons, Skills'
 * profile picker each take the row, and the review measured the h1 reading
 * "(" and "Scr…" with the subtitle wrapped one word per line (the UI review
 * of 2026-09-08, P1). The floor the component describes is `sm:min-w-[16rem]`,
 * which by its own prefix does not exist below sm, so on the one screen size
 * where the title needs a floor it had none.
 *
 * The fix is one class on one element: below sm the actions slot takes its
 * own full row unconditionally, so the title group is never sharing a row
 * with anything at 390. From sm up nothing changes. The gate that measures
 * it live is tests/e2e/phone.spec.ts: at 390 the h1's box is at least 12rem
 * wide on every route, and the subtitle runs to three lines at most.
