// T-0082 acceptance oracle — QA finding 7: a toolset PUT reports ENOENT and the
// change persists anyway.
//
// THE ROOT CAUSE, and it is one missing line. `pushProfileToHermes` calls
// `ensureProfileDirs(root)` before it writes. `pushRootToHermes` does not — the
// import is right there in the same file, three lines above the function that
// uses it. On a Hermes home without a `memories/` directory, write #5 of 7
// (`memories/USER.md`) ENOENTs after four files have already landed, so the
// push half-succeeds and reports a crash.
//
// WHY NO TEST CAUGHT IT. The existing suite mocks `pushRootToHermes` wholesale.
// A push that never touches a filesystem cannot notice a missing directory.
// This file drives the real function against a real, deliberately-bare
// directory, which is the only shape of test that could ever have failed.
//
// AND THE HONESTY HALF. Four smaller defects around the same failure:
//
//   * the error names the `.tmp-<pid>-<ts>` staging path, a file that does not
//     exist and never will, instead of the file the operator was trying to
//     write;
//   * the 500 says "failed" about a change that IS saved, so an operator who
//     reloads sees their edit and cannot tell whether it took;
//   * the drift banner headlines "Profile drift" when nothing has drifted and
//     the only problem is a sync ERROR;
//   * and `POST /api/agent/profiles/sync/push` answers 200 {success:false} for
//     the same failure the toolsets route answers 500 for -- while putting the
//     reason at `data.result.error`, where runWrite does not look, so the
//     operator gets a generic "Push failed" and never sees the ENOENT at all.

// every path this push touches is the one production would build -- the point
// of the file is that a directory is missing, and a hand-written bundle could
// have quietly disagreed about where that directory is.
//
// BOTH modules are mocked, and the reason is written here because getting it
// wrong is expensive. `profile-push` imports getHermesDefaultRoot from
// `profile-paths`, NOT from `agent-runtime`. Mocking only the latter leaves the
// real resolver in place, and the real resolver answers with the operator's
// actual Hermes home — so a test that believes it is writing to a temp
// directory writes SOUL.md, AGENTS.md and the memories over the top of somebody
// real. That happened while this file was being written. See the fuse below.
