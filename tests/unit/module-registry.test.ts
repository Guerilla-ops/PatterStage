/**
 * The module registry is the single source of navigation (ADR-0005).
 *
 * Before it, `sidebar-config.ts` was a hardcoded array that had to be mirrored
 * by hand into `tests/e2e/app-routes.ts`, and the mirror had drifted:
 * /laboratory/artifacts existed as a page and in the sidebar but was absent from
 * the route matrix, so the navigation tests silently stopped covering it.
 *
 * The last test here closes that class of bug: every top-level page in the app
 * must be reachable from the registry, or be listed as a deliberate exception.
