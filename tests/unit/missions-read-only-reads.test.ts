// Read-only mode still READS (T-0034, finding 6).
//
// The finding as filed: /api/missions/[id]/run carries no requireAuth while its
// siblings do, and the inconsistency invites the belief that a route without
// one is unprotected. Reading the code turns the finding inside out.
//
// `requireAuth()` in src/lib/api/api-auth.ts does not authenticate. Its own header
// says so: it is `requireNotReadOnly()` under a name it kept to avoid churning
// call sites during the security hotfix. Authentication is enforced once, in
// src/proxy.ts, on every request including this one — that is the lock-book's
// structural contract and `design-lint no-auth-in-route-handler` holds it.
//
// So the guard on these routes is the READ-ONLY guard, and src/proxy.ts already
// applies it by METHOD, the way it has to be applied: unsafe methods are
// refused, safe ones are not. Its own comment records what the per-route
// version cost: "the old per-route guards also fired on ~35 GET handlers, which
// 503'd the read-only UI it was meant to enable".
//
// Two of those thirty-five are in this directory. `GET /api/missions` and
// `GET /api/missions/[id]` answer 503 under PS_READ_ONLY, so an operator who
// set the flag to browse safely cannot see their missions at all. The run
// route, the one the finding called anomalous, is the only one in the family
// that was right.
//
// This is the repro, authored before the fix and kept forever.
