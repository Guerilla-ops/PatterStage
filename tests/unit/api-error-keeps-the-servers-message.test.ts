/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * The server explains itself, and the client must not throw the explanation
 * away.
 *
 * THE REPORTED SYMPTOM. Storing a memory with no provider configured showed a
 * toast reading "HTTP 500", and nothing else. The route did say why: the catch
 * branch of /api/memory/hindsight answers with
 * `{ data: { available: false, error: "<why>" } }`, which is the envelope every
 * Hindsight reader expects. `apiFetch` read only the TOP-LEVEL `error` field,
 * found none, and synthesised "HTTP <status>".
 *
 * That is a CLASS, not one bad toast. `apiFetch` is the single fetch helper
 * behind `safeApiCall`, `safeApiCallData` and `runWrite`,
 * so every caller of every route that nests its message lost it the same way.
 * The fix belongs in the helper, and these are its oracles.
 *
 * The other half of the fix is the wire shape itself (the route now sets the
 * top-level `error` too): see memory-without-a-provider-says-what-to-do.test.ts.
