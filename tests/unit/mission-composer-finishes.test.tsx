/**
 * T-0051 acceptance oracle — the composer finishes what it starts.
 *
 * The live QA pass reported "the New Mission dialog stays after a successful
 * create" and read the missing toast as a missing `showToast` call. Both halves
 * of that were wrong in an interesting way.
 *
 * The toast fires every time. It was rendering UNDERNEATH the sheet, which
 * T-0050 fixed. What remains, and what this file is about, is that the sheet
 * itself closes on only some branches:
 *
 *   create + save    closes, via resetForm()
 *   create + queue   closes, via resetForm()
 *   create + now     DOES NOT CLOSE
 *   create + cron    DOES NOT CLOSE
 *   edit  + update   closes, via closeComposer() + resetForm()
 *   edit  + promote  closes
 *   edit  + redispatch (a completed mission)  DOES NOT CLOSE
 *
 * There is no single "finish" step. `resetForm()` and `closeComposer()` are two
 * different ways to end, chosen per branch, so three branches ended up choosing
 * neither. Every one of those three also calls setExpandedId / fetchDetail,
 * which expands a row on the board BEHIND the still-open sheet, so the one
 * remaining piece of visual confirmation is occluded too.
 *
 * Three further defects in the same path, none of them reported:
 *
 *   · `setEditingId(null)` runs BEFORE the await, so mid-flight the sheet title
 *     flips from "Edit Mission" to "New Mission" and the dispatch gate can
 *     re-arm. If the request then fails, the operator is left in a
 *     create-shaped composer holding edit data.
 *   · `if (!isCompleted) return;` returns with no toast and no state change: a
 *     button that does nothing and says nothing.
 *   · `newSchedule` is not cleared by the form reset, so the next New Mission
 *     opens showing the previous mission's cron.
