/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * T-0047 acceptance oracle — the reach of the client deadline T-0040 added.
 *
 * T-0040 gave `apiFetch` a 45s ceiling to stop the chat composer sitting on
 * "Thinking…" forever. The justification was chat-specific — 45s sits above
 * HermesRuntime's own 30s gateway deadline so the server's real diagnosis wins
 * the race — but the constant governs EVERY call through `apiFetch`.
 *
 * That includes the bulk operations, which have no such 30s bound and no way
 * to ask for more: "Push all"/"Pull all" and the model-catalogue sync both go
 * through `runWrite` -> `apiFetch` with no caller signal, so a bulk sync
 * that legitimately runs past 45s is aborted mid-flight and reported to the
 * operator as a timeout. Seeding is the same shape.
 *
 * The deadline is right; its being a single un-overridable global is not.
