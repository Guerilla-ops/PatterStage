// llm-output — reading a model's final answer, not its working.
//
// These cases are salvaged from tests/unit/benchmarks-score-robustness.test.ts,
// which died with the benchmark subsystem. They are kept because the primitives
// were lifted into core and are now load-bearing in the product's real path:
// composer/verdict.ts strips reasoning before looking for a VERDICT, after a
// model deliberating "VERDICT: PASS" inside <think> was found routing on_pass
// for a stage that concluded FAIL.
