/**
 * U8 (T-0122): the three interaction primitives, built and oracled, not adopted.
 *
 * ── useDismissable and Popover ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ten components in this tree open a panel and close it by listening for a
 * mousedown somewhere else. They are ~1,778 lines and they are the same
 * fourteen lines fourteen times, except that they are not quite: six of them
 * are a keyboard trap, and the reason is always one of three.
 *
 *   NO ESCAPE. `ProfileSelector`, `SkillSelector`, `ToolsetSelector`,
 *   `TimeoutSelector` and `MissionTimeSelector` open a menu that a mouse can
 *   dismiss and a keyboard cannot. There is no Escape handler at all, so a
 *   keyboard user who opens one has no way back out except Tab, through every
 *   option in the list.
 *
 *   NO FOCUS RETURN. Choosing an option unmounts the panel that focus was
 *   inside, so focus falls to `document.body` and the next Tab starts from the
 *   top of the page. The trigger the user was standing on is gone.
 *
 *   A LISTENER THAT NEVER SLEEPS. The effect has an empty dependency array, so
 *   the document-level mousedown listener is registered whether the panel is
 *   open or shut. Ten of those are attached on every page that mounts one.
 *
 * `useDismissable` owns all three, and it is deliberately NOT `useDialogA11y`:
 * a popover is not a modal. It does not trap Tab (tabbing out of a menu should
 * close it and move on, not cycle inside it forever), it does not lock body
 * scroll, and it does not make the page inert. What the two DO share is the
 * topmost-only rule, and for the same reason: one Escape must close one thing.
 *
 * ── SegmentedControl ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Thirteen filter groups render their state as colour and nothing else. A
 * sighted user sees which of "All / Running / Failed" is active because it is
 * cyan; a screen reader is read three buttons and told nothing about any of
 * them. That is not a styling gap, it is the state being absent from the
 * accessibility tree entirely.
 *
 * So: a real `radiogroup` with `aria-checked`, and a roving tabindex, which is
 * the part that is easy to get wrong. The group holds ONE tab stop, not one
 * per option, and the arrow keys move within it. Thirteen groups today put
 * every option in the tab order, so tabbing across the missions filter bar
 * costs eleven keystrokes before reaching the board.
