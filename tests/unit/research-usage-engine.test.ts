/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * T-0030 acceptance oracle, engine half.
 *
 * Separate from the accumulateUsage half on purpose. That half imports a module
 * that does not exist yet, so its whole suite fails to RESOLVE, and a
 * resolution failure would hide these — which can run today, and go red for the
 * behaviour they describe rather than for a missing file.
 *
 * What is wrong today: `defaultLlm` returns `{ content: res.content }` and
 * drops `res.usage` on the floor, and `runDeepResearch` returns no usage at
 * all, so Deep Research spend cannot be counted even in principle.

  // nothing upstream honoured: defaultLlm forwarded correctly, this test proved
  // it, and every research run still recorded null tokens. A test whose mock
  // states the intended shape rather than the observed one is green by
  // construction.
  //
  // It is kept because the assertion is now TRUE -- callLLM normalises at the
  // boundary, so camelCase is what it really produces. What it is not is
  // evidence about the boundary itself. That lives in
  // tests/unit/llm-usage-is-normalised.test.ts, which drives the real callLLM
  // and fakes only the HTTP response.
