 * T-0051 — the seam nobody tested: picker → form state → POST body.
 *
 * `SchedulePicker.test.tsx` proves the picker emits the right string to a
 * `jest.fn()`. `dispatch-mode.test.ts` proves `scheduleForDispatch` passes a
 * schedule through for `cron` and drops it otherwise. Nothing joined them, so
 * nothing asserted that what the operator typed is what the server receives.
 *
 * That is exactly the gap a live QA pass fell into: it typed `5 1 * * *`,
 * submitted, and found `"every 5m"` on the wire. The picker was innocent; the
 * report's diagnosis ("one of the two fields is dead") was wrong. But the seam
 * being untested is why neither of us could tell without reading five files.
 *
 * ── AND THIS FILE DID NOT CLOSE THAT SEAM (T-0063) ──────────────
 *
 * It named itself after "picker -> form state -> POST body" and then tested
 * "picker -> jest.fn -> hook method". Every test below renders SchedulePicker
 * standalone against a hand-rolled onChange and calls `dispatchPayload`
 * directly. MissionCreateForm, the Schedule button and `handleCreate` are never
 * mounted, so the real click-to-POST path had no coverage at all.
 *
 * Worse, it carried a test titled "an invalid draft leaves the previous
 * schedule on the wire, and says so", which is a description of the DEFECT
 * written in the grammar of a guarantee. It asserted that onChange was not
 * called and a message appeared, and treated that as sufficient. It never
 * asserted that the POST was blocked. A second QA pass then typed garbage,
 * clicked Schedule, and got a mission on "every 5m" plus a green toast reading
 * "Mission scheduled: every 5m" -- a cadence the operator never typed.
 *
 * That test is deleted and replaced by the describe block at the foot of this
 * file, which renders the real submit path. The lesson is worth keeping: a test
 * whose title states the bug is worse than no test, because it converts an open
 * defect into a documented decision.
