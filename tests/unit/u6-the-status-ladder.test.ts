/**
 * U6 (T-0120), part two: one ladder for colour that means something.
 *
 * Measured across src/: 34 ad-hoc status-colour sites in 26 files - 15 object
 * literals keyed by a state word and 19 if/ternary chains over one. The
 * reconnaissance said 22 across ~20 files and named 18 exemplars, of which only
 * 7 are keyed on a state word at all; the other 11 are CATEGORICAL maps (an
 * artifact's source kind, a research step's kind, a notification's tone) that a
 * status ladder must not absorb. So the count was both an undercount and padded
 * with the wrong things.
 *
 * What the survey found that the recon missed is the sharpest case:
 * `ProcessesPanel` paints a Hermes process whose status is `running` in GREEN,
 * while every other screen in the product paints `running` cyan. Two screens
 * away, `failed` is `text-neon-pink` on both the composer and research - pink,
 * not the declared danger token.
 *
 * The fix is not a colour codemod. The product already has a module whose whole
 * job is that a status wears ONE word - `src/lib/ui/status-labels.ts`, thirteen
 * ratified words, typed with `satisfies` so a new enum member without a word is
 * a compile error. The colour belongs to the word, so a thing cannot be called
 * Failed and painted green: `STATUS_TONE` is `Record<StatusLabel, StatusTone>`
 * and is exhaustive by the same mechanism.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT absorb, each with a reason:
 *   - log SEVERITY (error/warn/info/debug) is not a run state
 *   - a notification's tone (success/error/info) is not an entity's status
 *   - `RUN_TONE_TEXT.good` is a deliberate NEUTRAL: an on-time duration is not
 *     a success, it is an absence of news
 *   - the workflow canvas's pending/skipped are structural EDGE tokens
 *   - an artifact's source kind and a research step's kind are categorical
