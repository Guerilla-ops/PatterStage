// T-0083 acceptance oracle — operator ruling 2, from QA finding 13.
//
// The reporter fired 130 requests at /api/sessions and never saw a 429. Two
// separate facts underneath:
//
//   1. A real sliding-window limiter EXISTS (sessions-api-guard.ts, 120/min)
//      and is wired to /api/sessions/[id] but NOT to the list route the tester
//      actually hit. That half is a wiring bug, tested separately.
//
//   2. The `ps_token` exchange has no brute-force protection at all. The
//      compare is constant-time, which stops a timing oracle and does nothing
//      about volume: an attacker on the LAN — `npm run start:network` binds
//      0.0.0.0 — can try tokens as fast as the event loop will take them.
//
// THE RULING was "auth throttle + fix wiring", not a general API limiter. So
// this covers the FAILED-AUTH path only, and its shape is decided by what
// PatterStage is: a local-first tool whose operator is usually indistinguishable
// from an attacker at the network layer, because on loopback both are "local".
//
// That rules out an UNBOUNDED lockout. A lock with no ceiling, keyed on a
// client that cannot be told apart from the operator, is a denial of service
// against the operator shipped as a security feature.
//
// What it does not rule out is a SHORT one, and a short one is the only kind
// that works. See the "door never welds shut" block below for why the softer
// alternative -- answer 429 but keep comparing -- is decoration: the attacker
// gets a comparison on every request either way and their guess rate is
// unchanged. So the penalty refuses to process at all, for seconds rather than
// minutes, and any correct token clears the record outright.
