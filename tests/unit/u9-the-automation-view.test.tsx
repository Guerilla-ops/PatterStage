/**
 * U9 (T-0123), part two: decision 9, one Automation view.
 *
 * Two surfaces answer "what is on a clock" and neither answers it fully.
 *
 *   `ScheduledMissions`, a section at the bottom of the Missions page, lists
 *   PatterStage's own schedule table. That table holds both kinds already - a
 *   recurring mission, and a script on a machine with no scheduler of its own -
 *   so it looks complete, and is not.
 *
 *   The Scripts page lists host scripts, each with its schedule inline. A
 *   script scheduled into the HOST crontab lives only there: PatterStage's
 *   table knows nothing about it, so it appears on Scripts and is missing from
 *   the schedules section entirely. An operator asking "what runs tonight" has
 *   to read two screens and know which kind lives where.
 *
 * The Automation view is the union, and the union has to be a real one: a
 * script scheduled through PatterStage appears in BOTH reads, and listing it
 * twice would be a worse answer than listing it once in the wrong place. The
 * host read is therefore filtered to the rows PatterStage does not own.
 *
 * Each row says what decision 9 asks for and the old section did not: what it
 * fires, its clock, when it runs next, when it last ran and how that ended, and
 * a way to the log. `lastStatus` alone was on the row before; a status with no
 * time and no log is a claim you cannot check.
 *
 * Missions keeps dispatch and loses its schedules section. Scripts keeps its
 * file list, and its per-row schedule action, which is a property of a file
 * rather than a section about clocks.
