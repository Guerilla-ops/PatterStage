/** @jest-environment node */

// T-0080 acceptance oracle — the gateway error stops being a Node string.
//
// THE DEFECT (QA finding 6, confirmed and sharpened by a browser pass). Send a
// chat turn with the gateway stopped and PatterStage stores, and renders,
//
//     fetch failed: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8652
//
// That is undici talking to itself. It names an address the operator never
// typed, does not say what the address IS, and does not say what to do. It
// reaches SEVEN storage columns across six tables -- worst of them
// `missions.result`, where a Node transport string is presented as the outcome
// of the operator's work.
//
// THE SEAM. All seven read the error through `messageFromError`, which walks
// the cause chain. So the fix belongs at the two places the raw fetch actually
// happens -- `HermesRuntime.fetchJson` and `streamRunEvents` -- where
// `ep.baseUrl` is in scope and the address can be named as what it is. Fixing
// it there fixes all seven at once, and any eighth added later.
//
// AND THE BROWSER HALF (P0-4, P0-5). `GatewayBanner` hardcodes "port 8642" and
// said so while the gateway was on 8652, sending the operator to fix a port
// that was not the one that was down. Its actionable copy is also gated behind
// an EMPTY chat, so the operator most likely to need it -- mid-conversation,
// having just watched a turn fail -- is the one who cannot see it.
