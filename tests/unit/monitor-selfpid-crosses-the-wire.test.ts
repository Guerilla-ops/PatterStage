// T-0071 · F10 — selfPid has to survive the trip, and no type can promise it.
//
// The scheduler pill warns "this process (pid N) will not dispatch" only when
// `selfPid` and `ownerPid` disagree (dashboard/scheduler-pill.ts). That is the
// one signal an operator gets when a second PatterStage process is running and
// theirs is the one that will never fire a schedule.
//
// `readSchedulerHealth` returns selfPid, `SchedulerHealth` declares it, and the
// route spreads the object — every link is annotated and correct. None of that
// survives JSON: whatever fetches /api/monitor parses the response as `any`, so
// a field silently stopping at the boundary is invisible to the compiler and to
// every existing test, which mocks the health module and asserts on the mock.
//
// That is T-0068's defect exactly — a declared type that was a lie the compiler
// was structurally unable to detect, because the only place the shape is
// asserted is an unvalidated JSON boundary. The fence is a runtime assertion on
// the payload, so this file uses the REAL health module.
//
// THIS FILE WAS GREEN THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN, and that is stated rather than
// buried. selfPid does cross the wire today; the reporter flagged F10 with
// explicit uncertainty and they were right to. It is a FENCE, not a fix — the
// only thing standing between the pill's warning and a silent regression, since
// no type and no other test can see that boundary. An oracle that starts green
// earns its place only when it can go red, so the mutation record for T-0071
// includes deleting the field from the payload.
