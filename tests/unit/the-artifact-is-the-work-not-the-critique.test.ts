// The artifact a run files is the work, not the commentary on the work.
//
// THE DEFECT, found by running a real workflow. captureComposerArtifact files
// `fromNodeRun.output` -- whatever stage happened to route to the end -- under
// the run's objective as its name and "Composer run output" as its description.
// "Draft and review" ends on its REVIEWER, so what was filed as the run's
// deliverable was the critique of the deliverable, named after the objective as
// though it were the thing itself. The draft, the only thing anyone wanted to
// keep, was filed nowhere.
//
// THE RULE THIS PINS: the deliverable is the last completed stage that PRODUCED
// work rather than judged it, and the name says which stage that was. The
// artifacts list renders the name and never the description, so the name is
// where the honesty has to live.
//
// It agrees with the fix already made this round -- the starter workflow now
// ends on an inert `done` marker so its `write` stage actually runs -- and the
// second describe below is that workflow's shape, pinned so the two cannot
// drift apart.
