/**
 * U14 · The ring paints, and motion stops when asked.
 *
 * Two promises the token layer made that the tree did not keep.
 *
 * THE RING. globals.css declares the console's one focus indicator: a 2px
 * neon-cyan outline on :focus-visible, in @layer base, once. The field kit
 * then removed it on every text input, select and toggle it renders
 * (`outline-none`, on T-0122's own primitives) and painted a 1px ring at 30%
 * alpha in its place. That ring fires on :focus rather than :focus-visible,
 * so a mouse click drew it and a keyboard user got a third of the indicator
 * every other control in the product has. And the house `transition-colors`
 * is Tailwind's, which transitions outline-color too, so on every control
 * wearing it the ring faded in from grey over 150ms and a fast tabber never
 * saw it cyan. The comment beside the duration tokens has said "in U14"
 * since T-0116. This is U14.
 *
 * MOTION. The reduced-motion block was an allowlist of seven class names,
 * written when there were seven animations. There are fourteen keyframes in
 * the file and nine Tailwind animate-* utilities in the tree, and the
 * reconnaissance measured 28 animations still running under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, the logo's flame on all 25 screens among
 * them (WCAG 2.3.3). An allowlist can only ever name what its author knew
 * about. The rule inverts to deny by default, with one re-enable: a spinner,
 * which is information (still working) rather than decoration.
 *
 * These are the source oracles. The live half is tests/e2e/motion.spec.ts,
 * gate 10, which counts what actually runs under reduce on every route.
