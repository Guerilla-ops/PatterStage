/**
 * C0 · The line census.
 *
 * The consolidation programme's referee. The UI overhaul measured the
 * rendered product with a census that could only fall; this measures the
 * source the same way: lines by tree, lines inside a repeated window, and
 * the shapes the programme is making one (the route body, the hand-rolled
 * read, the write without the hook, the repeated type, the one-importer
 * component, the flat lib root, the comment essay, the inline db mock). A
 * baseline holds today's numbers; a batch that moves one the wrong way fails
 * the gate, and `--allow-growth "<reason>"` records the reason when it must.
 *
 * The ratchet is proven against a fixture tree, not the real one: a
 * baseline is cut, a file grows, the census refuses; the file shrinks, the
 * census passes and says what fell.

/**
 * The measures the census declares, each of which the baseline must hold.
 *
 * Amended 2026-09-12 (T-0154, K6), under operator ruling Q-015 (2026-09-12),
 * which permits a closed-programme oracle to change for the one key its ruled
 * item fixes, dated, and by a session that does not implement the fix. This
 * amendment adds ONE key and touches nothing else in this file.
 *
 * What changed and why: `scriptsLines`, for tooling-22. line-census.mjs:50-51
 * walked src and tests alone, so scripts/ — the tooling that gates every batch,
 * the mock servers' neighbours and the harness — was unmeasured by the ratchet
 * that referees the programme. A census that cannot see the code its own gates
 * are written in sets the next plan's targets against numbers that are not
 * true. The measure is a new key in line-census.mjs and a new number in
 * line-census.baseline.json; this list is where the two are held together, and
 * c8's key set changes with it (see c8-the-programme-is-closed.test.ts).
 *
 * Red until tooling-22 lands: the baseline holds no scriptsLines yet, which is
 * exactly what this case is for.
