// T-0077 · the label the operator ruled for, asserted by rendering it.
//
// FOUND BY MUTATION. The first version of this check grepped the component's
// source for "built-in default". Replacing the JSX condition with `{false && (`
// left that string sitting in the file — in the very comment explaining why the
// banner exists — so the assertion passed while the banner was unreachable.
// Grepping a file for a phrase proves the phrase is in the file, and nothing
// else.
//
// WHY THE BANNER EXISTS. The shipped default is hindsight@127.0.0.1:9177, and
// 9177 is exactly where a real Hindsight listens. A second install on one
// machine therefore connects to the first operator's memory and renders their
// facts as its own — which is not hypothetical, it is what a throwaway QA
// instance did. The operator ruled the zero-config connect stays, so the
// product says out loud that it GUESSED until somebody presses Save.
