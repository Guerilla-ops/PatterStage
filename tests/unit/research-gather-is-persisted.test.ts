// T-0070 — the seam between the engine that COUNTS a degraded gather and the
// row that has to remember it.
//
// FOUND BY MUTATION, AND IT IS THE WHOLE DEFECT. Deleting the `gather:` field
// from run-job's terminal `updateResearchRun` call left all 85 research tests
// green. The counters would have gone straight back to being computed and
// thrown away -- which is precisely the state T-0070 was opened to end -- and
// nothing anywhere would have said so.
//
// Everything on either side of this seam was covered and the seam was not:
// deep-research-search-outage.test.ts drives the engine and asserts the numbers
// it produces, and the caveat formatter has its own tests. Neither runs
// run-job, so neither could see the numbers being dropped between them. It is
// the shape of T-0068's defect exactly -- two well-tested ends and an untested
// strip in the middle, which is the only code that has ever been wrong.
