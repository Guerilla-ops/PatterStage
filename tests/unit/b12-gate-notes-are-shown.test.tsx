// B12 oracle, group gate-notes, UI half (D8, major).
//
// Written before the product code moved. Contract section 6.1: the stage
// sheet -- the one panel in Composer that already explains a stage, with its
// verdict, its reasons, its suggestions and its output -- shows the gate
// decisions taken on that stage, and the note the operator typed with them.
//
// Today ComposerNodeRunDetail has no idea approvals exist. The note is
// written to composer_approvals and read by nothing but the router, so the
// sentence explaining a rejection is visible to no one, ever, anywhere in the
// product.
//
// The `approvals` prop is cast in (pre-B12 type shim) so this file
// type-checks against today's signature while asserting tomorrow's.
