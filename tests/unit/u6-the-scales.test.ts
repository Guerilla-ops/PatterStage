/**
 * U6 (T-0120), part three: the radius scale, and paint nobody applies.
 *
 * RADIUS. 663 `rounded-*` occurrences across 177 files, in 11 spellings
 * producing 7 rendered radii - 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16 and pill. Forty files paint
 * an 8px card edge on the same screen as a 12px one. The scale is three rungs
 * plus the pill, and two of the three conversions are pixel-identical:
 * `rounded-lg` (8px, 316 sites) IS `rounded-ps-md`, `rounded-xl` (12px, 111)
 * IS `rounded-ps-lg`. The two that move are `rounded-md` (6px, between the
 * rungs, no pixel-preserving answer exists) and `rounded-2xl` (16px, nine sites
 * of one identical card recipe).
 *
 * GLOW. Five `.glow-*` classes, `.text-glow-purple`, `.ps-electrified` and
 * `.animate-pulse-glow` have ZERO call sites between them. `.text-glow-cyan`
 * has exactly one - the word "Yours" in the rail's brand lockup - and is the
 * trap: it looks like the other seven and is not.
 *
 * And a live accessibility defect the survey turned up on the way. The
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` guard names `.animate-pulse-glow`, which nothing
 * uses. The class that IS used is `.pulse-glow`, on the dashboard's ONLINE dot
 * and on every StatusDot in the product, and it is not in the guard at all - so
 * an operator who asked their OS for reduced motion gets a dot pulsing forever
 * on the front door. WCAG 2.3.3. Deleting the unused name without adding the
 * used one would leave the guard naming nothing at all.
