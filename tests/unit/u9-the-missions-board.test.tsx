/**
 * U9 (T-0123), part one: the busiest screen.
 *
 * Four things, and the first is the one the operator would name.
 *
 * ── the board is inset from the strip above it ────────────────
 *
 * `AppPageShell` owns the measure (T-0117): one container, one left edge, and
 * every page's h1 shares it with its content by construction. `MissionsList`
 * then opens with `<div className="w-full max-w-none px-6 py-6">` and puts its
 * whole body 24px further right than `MissionInsights`, which is its immediate
 * sibling.
 *
 * The geometry gate cannot see this. It asserts `h1.left === contentLeft`, and
 * contentLeft is the LEFTMOST content block - which is the insights strip,
 * correctly aligned. A page whose blocks disagree with EACH OTHER passes a gate
 * that only ever compares one of them to the heading. So the instrument grows a
 * second reading here: how many left edges the page's own ROWS start at. One
 * container means one. Rows rather than blocks, because a grid's second column
 * is a block at a different left and is exactly where it belongs - a first cut
 * of this compared blocks and called 15 of 23 routes broken, almost all of it
 * grid.
 *
 * ── the board clips its last column, by arithmetic ────────────
 *
 * Five columns at `min-w-[240px]` with `gap-4` need 1264px. Inside the rail at
 * 1440 the content column is about 1136. The row is `overflow-x-auto`, so the
 * overflow is silent and FAILED - the last column, and the one you look for -
 * is the half that goes off the edge. It is not a narrow-viewport problem; it
 * is every viewport, because a fixed minimum times five is wider than the
 * column at any width the rail leaves.
 *
 * A grid that wraps says the same thing without a scrollbar: at 1440 three
 * columns and then two, at 1024 two, at 390 one. Nothing is hidden, and the
 * board stops being a horizontal scroller inside a vertical scroller.
 *
 * ── status is counted three times and filterable without ARIA ─
 *
 * The strip draws four count tiles, the board draws five column counts, and
 * the filter row draws five buttons with no counts and no state anything but a
 * sighted user can perceive. The counts belong ON the filter, where they say
 * what you are about to filter TO; the tiles restate the columns directly
 * below them and go. The donut and the success ring stay: a mix and a rate are
 * not a count, and you cannot get either by reading the board.
 *
 * ── and both filter rows become real ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Status and mission-category are two of the thirteen filter groups that
 * render their state as colour alone. They are `SegmentedControl` now: a
 * radiogroup with a name, `aria-checked`, and one tab stop instead of eleven.
