// T-0069 acceptance oracle — a rejected Composer gate must say so, and must not
// strand the operator.
//
// WHAT WORKS ALREADY, and is pinned here so the fix cannot regress it: rejecting
// a gate that has no `on_reject` edge ends the run with a genuinely good
// sentence, built by describeStageFailure -- "Gate was rejected and the workflow
// has no recovery path from here."
//
// WHAT DOES NOT. That sentence is written to `composer_runs.error` and then
// never reaches a human:
//
//   1. applyNext's fail branch writes ONLY the run row. The rejected gate's
//      node-run keeps the `completed` that finalizeComposerNodeRun just wrote,
//      so the canvas draws it GREEN, labelled completed, two elements below a
//      pink "failed" run header. The picture contradicts the status line.
//   2. The approve route's guard answers a bare "Run is not awaiting approval"
//      while run.status and run.error are both in scope. The exact sentence the
//      operator needs is sitting in the variable being tested.
//
// THE OPERATOR RULED for a distinct `rejected` terminal state rather than
// reusing `failed`, so a rejection renders as the deliberate act it is. That
// needs migration 035, because SQLite cannot ALTER a CHECK constraint -- and the
// harness below proves it, because the beforeEach applies the real appliers and
// an unwidened CHECK makes the write throw rather than quietly pass.
//
// WHY THIS DRIVES THE REAL ENGINE against real SQLite rather than reading source
// with regexes. A source-shape assertion cannot tell a status that is WRITTEN
// from one that is merely permitted, and `cancelled` is already proof that the
// difference is not theoretical: it is in the CHECK, in the union, read in two
// places, and written nowhere. `rejected` must not become the second one.
