/**
 * U6 (T-0120), part one: colour that is actually there.
 *
 * Tailwind scans source statically and generates a utility only for a class it
 * can SEE as a literal string. `globals.css` says `@import "tailwindcss"` with
 * no `@source`, so v4's automatic detection scans the whole project bar what
 * .gitignore excludes: `org/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, every task record and every
 * markdown file. A class name written in PROSE therefore becomes real CSS.
 *
 * Measured: 94 candidate-shaped strings, 46 of them naming a colour, exist in
 * the shipped stylesheet only because a file outside `src/` mentions them. Some
 * are classes these batches deliberately deleted from the product -
 * `bg-dark-900/50`, `bg-ps-surface-well`, `border-white/10` - still emitted
 * because the reconnaissance describes them.
 *
 * And one of them is load-bearing. The dashboard's Spend pill has a border
 * because `border-yellow-400/20` appears exactly once in the repository, in
 * `org/reviews/2026-09-ui-recon.md`, the document REPORTING that the border
 * does not work. StatPill builds that class with
 * `textColor.replace(/^text-/, "border-") + "/20"`, which Tailwind cannot see.
 * Pinning the scan to `src/` and rebuilding, the pill's border computes to
 * `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.92)`: the solid white ring the recon described. The
 * recon was right, and committing it is what made it wrong.
 *
 * So the fix is two-sided. Pin the scan, so the stylesheet is what the code
 * asks for; and stop building class names by string surgery, so the code asks
 * for what it means.
