/**
 * /api/memory/route.ts — regression tests for the unified
 * `unsupportedWriteHandler` refactor. Before the refactor, the
 * POST/PUT/DELETE handlers each had 4 lines of identical code:
 *
 *   const auth = requireAuth(request);
 *   if (auth) return auth;
 *   return UNSUPPORTED_WRITE_RESPONSE;
 *
 * After the refactor, they all share `unsupportedWriteHandler` so a
 * single change to the message or the auth wiring affects all four
 * verbs at once. This test pins the contract:
 *
 *   - All four write verbs return 400 with the same error string.
 *   - All four write verbs still run the auth check (a missing
 *     AUTH_HEADER should yield a 401, not a 400).

  // Read-only refusal is no longer asserted here, because it is no longer

  // every unsafe method under PS_READ_ONLY before a handler runs, so a test that
  // calls this handler directly bypasses the thing it means to check. The
  // guarantee is asserted per route, in both directions, in
  // tests/unit/read-only-actually-reads.test.ts.
