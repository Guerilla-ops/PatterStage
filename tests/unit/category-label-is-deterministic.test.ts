/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * T-0053 acceptance oracle — a category renders the same label whatever order
 * the catalogue arrives in.
 *
 * The QA pass reported this as a regression in the T-0037 dedup: "CONTROL HUB
 * and CONTROLHUB render as separate rows". That claim is REFUTED. `CONTROLHUB`
 * has no separator, so it title-cases to `Controlhub`, a different label from
 * `Control Hub`, and the module says in as many words that a spelling which
 * renders differently keeps its own bucket. Two rows with two different labels
 * is the design working.
 *
 * But the observation was not nothing, and chasing it found a real defect in
 * the code T-0037 shipped, which is mine.
 *
 * `titleCaseCategory` upper-cases the first letter of each word and never
 * lowercases the rest, so `CONTROL HUB` renders as `CONTROL HUB`. All four of
 * `Control Hub`, `control-hub`, `control_hub` and `CONTROL HUB` land in ONE
 * bucket, correctly. But `skills-page-helpers.ts` takes that bucket's label from
 * `items[0].category` — the first row the catalogue happened to return. So the
 * heading reads `Control Hub` or `CONTROL HUB` depending on data order.
 *
 * That is precisely the failure the module's own comment says the design exists
 * to prevent:
 *
 *   "merging labels that do not match would leave the header text depending on
 *    whichever row the catalogue returned first"
 *
 * It is also what the QA agent actually saw: a shouting row heading.
