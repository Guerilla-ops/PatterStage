/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-require-imports -- better-sqlite3's package root is not newable under the jest transform; same construction as agent-progression-immutability.test.ts */

// T-0081 acceptance oracle, behavioural half. Its sibling
// `the-numbers-stop-lying.test.ts` proves no meta key is an orphan; this proves
// the numbers actually move, which is the part a source scan cannot reach.
//
// Every test here is one of the five causes behind two QA findings:
//
//   /api/status   reports skillsCount and sessionsCount from a meta table
//                 nothing writes. The existing test mocked the getter and
//                 asserted the echo -- proving the plumbing while the tap was
//                 dry (the T-0075 class).
//   RC-A          progression is captured only inside GET /api/stats, so an
//                 API-driven pass never captures and the reader returns rows
//                 that were never written.
//   RC-C          countAgentActiveDays matches `profile_name = ?`; a root-agent
//                 run stores NULL. Its sibling coalesces. So one run counts for
//                 XP and not for active days.
//   RC-D          the root agent is absent from /api/agents/experience, which
//                 lists profiles only -- and it is the agent a default install
//                 actually uses.
//   runsCompleted counts every run whatever its status, under a name and a UI
//                 label that both say "completed".
