// T-0082, the honesty half of QA finding 7.
//
// The reported symptom was not only the ENOENT. It was that the toolset PUT
// answered 500 "failed" over a change that WAS saved — the DB write happens
// first, deliberately and documented — so the operator reloaded, saw their edit
// sitting there, and could not tell whether it had taken.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, and why. The obvious repair is to invert the order:
// push first, commit on success. That is not available here. Both push
// functions READ the committed row — pushRootToHermes calls getAgentRoot(),
// pushProfileToHermes calls getProfile(slug) — so there is nothing to push
// before the commit without restructuring them to take a proposed state. The
// honest fix at this size is to say what actually happened, which is what the
// operator needed in the first place: the change is saved, the mirror to Hermes
// is not, and nothing is lost.
//
// AND THE STATUS SPLIT. `POST /api/agent/profiles/sync/push` answered 200
// {success:false} for the same failure the toolsets route answered 500 for. It
// also put the reason at `data.result.error`, while runWrite looks at
// `data.error` — so the operator saw a bare "Push failed" and never the ENOENT
// underneath it. Single-target pushes now answer 500 carrying the reason. Batch
// pushes stay 200, because partial success across many profiles is a real
// outcome and not a server error, but they name the failures where the client
// actually reads.
