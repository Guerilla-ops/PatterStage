/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * T-0053 — the boot log says how this instance is configured.
 *
 * The QA pass lost THREE sessions to silent flag loss: an external watchdog
 * restarted the server without the session's environment, and nothing on screen
 * or in the log said the mode had changed. One of those sessions produced a
 * finding that had to be retracted ("read-only lets writes through" — it did
 * not; the flag was simply absent).
 *
 * A boot line naming the operational flags costs nothing and ends that whole
 * class of confusion, for an operator as much as for a QA agent. It sits beside
 * the `[auth]` line, which is the one line everybody already reads.
 *
 * NOT included, and worth recording why: the advertised PORT. It was reported as
 * derived from `process.env.PORT ?? "3000"` rather than from `-p`, which is true
 * of the source but not of the behaviour. Next assigns `process.env.PORT` at
 * bind time, before instrumentation runs. Measured on a real server booted with
 * `-p 3494` and no PORT in the environment: the boot line advertised 3494.
