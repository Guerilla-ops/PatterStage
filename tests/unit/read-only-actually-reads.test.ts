/**
 * T-0048 acceptance oracle — read-only mode reads.
 *
 * `src/proxy.ts:171` has claimed since the security hotfix that "enforcing here
 * means read-only actually reads", and `src/app/api/missions/[id]/run/route.ts`
 * states the rule the tree was supposed to be normalised onto: "A GET that
 * refuses to answer under PS_READ_ONLY is a read-only mode that cannot read."
 *
 * T-0034 applied that to the `missions` directory and stopped there, by its own
 * invariant I2. The rest of the tree never followed. `requireAuth()` is a thin
 * alias for `requireNotReadOnly()` (`api-auth.ts:126`), and 34 GET handlers
 * across 33 files still call it, so `PS_READ_ONLY=1` 503s `/api/config`,
 * `/api/models`, `/api/skills`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/monitor` and `/api/logs`
 * — the dashboard's core reads. The mode blanks the UI it exists to enable.
 *
 * WHY IT SURVIVED 33 ROUTES, which is what the structural tests below exist to
 * stop: `tests/helpers/api-test-helpers.ts` USED TO MOCK `@/lib/api/api-auth`
 * wholesale with `isReadOnly: () => false`, and roughly fifteen files repeated
 * that inline. Read-only mode did not exist in the unit suite. (The helper
 * mocks api-auth no longer at all — tests-13, T-0154 — and
 * `read-only-is-testable.test.ts` holds it to that.) A test that asserts a route
 * answers under read-only cannot be written against a mock that has already
 * decided the answer, so these assertions read the real module and the real
 * environment variable.
