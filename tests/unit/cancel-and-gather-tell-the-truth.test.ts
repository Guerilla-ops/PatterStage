// T-0070 acceptance oracle — five places where PatterStage stores what happened
// and then tells the operator something else.
//
// F4 THE OPERATOR CANCELS AND THE BOARD SAYS "Failed". The mission status enum
// has no `cancelled` and the operator ruled it stays that way -- but the RUN row
// already records `cancelled`, honestly, and describeMissionRunState reads only
// the mission's `status`. The fact is already stored and simply not read.
//
// THE TWO CANCEL ENTRY POINTS DIVERGE, which makes F4's fix unreliable as well
// as being a defect of its own:
//
//   POST /api/missions {action:"cancel"}   clears queuedForRun, writes an audit
//                                          line, and touches the run row only
//                                          via a BACKGROUND call, and only when
//                                          the mission was dispatched
//   POST /api/missions/[id]/cancel         does neither of the first two
//
// The stranded `queued_for_run = 1` is latent today only because
// getNextQueuedMission also filters on status='queued'. One more filter change
// and a cancelled mission re-dispatches itself. And because the run row is only
// written in the background, the board would show "Failed" until that landed --
// so converging the two is a PREREQUISITE for the label above, not a tidy-up.
//
// ONE EVENT READS TWO WAYS. hermesStatusFromEndReason maps the agent's
// `interrupt` to session `completed`; PatterStage's own cancel writes `failed`
// for the identical event. Whichever writer wins the race decides what the
// operator sees. The function has no test at all.
//
// A RENAME WIPES THE OUTPUT. mission-promote-handler passes `result: null`
// unconditionally. The intent is right -- clear stale output when a mission is
// RE-ACTIVATED -- but `dispatchMode:"save"` is the no-op used purely to rename,
// and it takes the same line.
//
// A DEGRADED GATHER IS INVISIBLE. The engine counts searchAttempts and
// searchFailures and the caller reads them for exactly one case: ALL of them
// failed. Five failures out of eight is a report written from a third of the
// evidence, marked `completed`, with nothing recorded and nothing said. Visits
// are worse -- a null page is skipped silently and counted nowhere at all.
