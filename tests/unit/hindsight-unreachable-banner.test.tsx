/**
 * A PatterStage install with no memory provider running is a supported state.
 * The regression this pins: the list endpoint answers 503 when nothing is
 * listening, `hindsightGet` turns a non-2xx into `null`, and that null used to
 * land in the SUCCESS branch of loadRecentMemories. `health` stayed null, the
 * health banner never rendered, and the page told a first-time user "No memories
 * yet. Hermes will start storing them as you converse" while there was no
 * memory provider at all.
 *
 * Amended for T-0101: the sentence is still said, and still exactly once, but
 * the browser no longer says it. It reports the health upward and the provider
 * card at the top of the page renders it, inside the card carrying the host and
 * port that fix it. The page is therefore what this file renders, and "exactly
 * once" is now an assertion rather than a structural accident.
