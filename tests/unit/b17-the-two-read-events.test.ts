// T-0111: the two READ events, and the one place each is knowable.
//
// The operator ruled on 2026-09-06 that chapter 4 keeps its six steps, which
// means the ledger records two reads: `artifact.opened` and `logs.opened`.
// Every other type in the taxonomy is a write, and B4's own rule says a type is
// emitted "only after its write succeeded and only from a write path", so these
// two need their own account:
//
//   - They are emitted SERVER-side, from the GET handler the screen already
//     calls. There is deliberately no POST on /api/analytics, because a client
//     that could write this ledger could forge the quest progress that reads it.
//   - They fire on the path that actually hands the thing over. A 404 for an
//     artifact that does not exist, or for a log directory that was never
//     written, is not somebody reading something.
//
// The repositories and the filesystem are doubles, so what the handler did NOT
// record is as assertable as what it did.
