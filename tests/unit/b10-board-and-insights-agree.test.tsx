// B10 oracle, group missions (C126, the walk finding the plan folds into
// D70/D72: "the insights strip agrees with the board — one count set, the
// ratified status labels").
//
// Written before the product code moved. Holds contract section 6.
//
// The defect: the missions page counts its missions three times, in three
// vocabularies, and two of the three disagree on the facts.
//
//   1. computeMissionCounts (mission-filters.ts) -> {active, completed, failed,
//      drafts, queued}, reached through useMissionsFiltering.missionCounts and
//      useMissionsPage, and rendered by NOTHING. Dead.
//   2. MissionsList counts per column with missionBoardColumn and labels the
//      columns "Drafts / Queued / Dispatched / Completed / Failed", with filter
//      chips reading "all / draft / queued / dispatched / successful / failed".
//   3. MissionInsights counts m.status straight into {queued, dispatched,
//      successful, failed} and labels them "Total / Active / Done / Failed".
//
// Set 3 is not merely differently worded. A save-draft mission is
// `status: "queued", queuedForRun: false`: a DRAFT in column 2, and Queued —
// and therefore Active — in strip 3. The same board, two answers.
//
// The contract: one counting function keyed on the board's own columns
// (countMissionsByColumn), one label map typed against the ratified thirteen
// words (MISSION_COLUMN_LABELS), and both surfaces read them.
