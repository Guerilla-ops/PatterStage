// T-0077 acceptance oracle — the memory provider the database says is active is
// the one the product talks to, and the one it names.
//
// THE REPORTED SYMPTOM. Switch the provider to holographic via
// PUT /api/memory/config, reload, and the page still reports hindsight with the
// same facts. The QA pass diagnosed it as GET /api/memory re-parsing the agent's
// config.yaml. That is not it — and the distinction matters, because the
// config.yaml read is DELIBERATE and documented: docs/guides/memory.md says the file is
// consulted for exactly one thing, recognising a holographic install, and
// "does not decide where Hindsight is reached". Migration 022's own header says
// PatterStage is "the source of truth for WHICH memory provider is active and
// HOW to reach it".
//
// THERE ARE THREE REAL DEFECTS, and any one of them reproduces the report.
//
//   RC-1  registry.ts switches on the type and its `default:` builds a
//         HindsightMemoryProvider. Every type is Hindsight, so flipping the DB
//         row is structurally unobservable.
//   RC-2  GET /api/memory hardcodes `provider: "hindsight"` in the success body
//         regardless of what was resolved.
//   RC-3  the sharpest. getActiveMemoryConfig ignores an active-but-DISABLED
//         row and substitutes a hardcoded hindsight@127.0.0.1:9177 — and
//         updateMemoryProvider's insert path writes `enabled = patch.enabled ? 1
//         : 0`, so a PUT that sets makeActive and omits enabled CREATES exactly
//         that row, returns 200, and every reader silently talks to 9177.
//
// THAT IS ALSO HOW A QA INSTANCE READ THE OPERATOR'S REAL MEMORY. A throwaway
// install seeds hindsight@127.0.0.1:9177 active, and 9177 is where a real
// Hindsight listens. The operator ruled: keep the zero-config connect, but say
// out loud that it is the built-in default until they have confirmed it. That
// needs no migration — `updated_at !== created_at` already records whether a
// human has ever saved the row.
//
// WHY IT SURVIVED. GET /api/memory has no in-app consumer at all (the page
// reads /api/memory/config and /api/memory/hindsight), and no test asserts that
// makeActive changes what getActiveMemoryProvider returns. That assertion is the
// first one below.
