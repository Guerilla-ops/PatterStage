/**
 * C3 · One way to write.
 *
 * A screen that wrote to the API said the same six things around the call
 * in four different helpers and by hand: mark busy, call, say what happened,
 * reload, say why on a throw, clear busy. `runSyncAction` said them for the
 * sync pages (T-0047), `runMutation` for the dashboard and the hindsight
 * hooks, `hindsightMutate` for the rest of hindsight, `runFallbackMutation`
 * for the fallback chain, and `toastFromResult` + try/catch/finally for the
 * mission and model hooks. One helper now, `runWrite` in lib/api-write.ts;
 * the others are gone, and every named writer is the call and its words.
 * react-query's `useMutation` stays for the hooks that own query keys and
 * invalidate them; that is the other sanctioned way, and the lint rule
 * says so.
 *
 * On the read side, the Story Weaver pages listed themes, characters and
 * stories in a hand-rolled effect around a POST read; they read through
 * useApiResource with a body, the way every other screen reads (T-0129).
 * The census's read measure walks the AST for a fetch reachable from a
 * useEffect callback, so a loader called from an effect is seen and a write
 * in a click handler is not.
 *
 * The recon: org/reviews/2026-09-consolidation-recon.md §3.
