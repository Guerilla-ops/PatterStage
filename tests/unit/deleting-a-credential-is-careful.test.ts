// T-0083 acceptance oracle — operator ruling 3, from QA finding 17 (Section D).
//
// There is no way to delete a credential. Every piece is already built:
// `deleteCredential` exists as the POST rollback path,
// `removeCredentialFromHermesEnv` exists as production code whose own docstring
// says "Used when a credential is deleted", and `models.credentials_id` is
// `ON DELETE SET NULL`. The door was never hung.
//
// THE HAZARD, and the reason this file is longer than the route.
// `upsertCredential`'s docstring claims credentials are "matched by provider
// (unique constraint)". There is no unique constraint. Migration 001 creates a
// plain `CREATE INDEX idx_credentials_provider`, so two rows CAN share a
// provider — and the `.env` var is per-PROVIDER, not per-row. Deleting one of
// two OpenAI keys must not blank OPENAI_API_KEY out from under the other,
// which is what a naive "delete row, remove env var" would do.
//
// The second hazard is quieter: a model attached to the deleted credential is
// silently unlinked by the foreign key and stops working at its next call. The
// operator is told, at the moment they can still change their mind.
