// T-0068 acceptance oracle — the provider's token counts must survive the trip
// into a research run.
//
// THE DEFECT, and it is the third of its family. Deep Research persists NULL for
// every token column on EVERY run. T-0030 added the columns and the plumbing at
// both ends; the two ends have never spoken the same key names.
//
//   llm.ts (gateway)        `usage: data.usage`  -> {prompt_tokens, ...}
//   llm.ts (openai direct)  `usage: data.usage`  -> {prompt_tokens, ...}
//   usage.ts accumulate     reads call.promptTokens -> undefined -> skipped
//
// Every call is skipped, `sawAny` stays false, the accumulator returns null, and
// the run is written as "never recorded".
//
// WHY THE COMPILER DID NOT CATCH IT. Every annotation in the chain is correct
// and correctly placed: LLMResponse.usage is declared camelCase, and both
// callers are annotated to return it. The laundering is one expression --
// `Response.json()` is typed `Promise<any>` in the DOM lib, so `data.usage` is
// `any` and assigns to anything. `strict: true` does not close that. The
// Anthropic branch fifteen lines above escapes precisely because an explicit
// cast forced its author to NAME the wire shape and build a new object.
//
// WHY THE TESTS WERE GREEN. tests/unit/research-usage-engine.test.ts is titled
// "defaultLlm stops discarding what callLLM reported" and mocks callLLM
// returning CAMELCASE -- which the real callLLM never produces. It encodes the
// intended contract as its fixture, so it is green by construction and could
// never have failed. This file therefore drives the REAL boundary, faking only
// the HTTP response, which is the shape tests/unit/composer-spend-is-counted.ts
// took for T-0058.
//
// THE HARM. spend-summary's foldResearch drops any run whose promptTokens is
// null, so 100% of Deep Research spend is excluded from budgetSpentUsd -- the
// number the optional hard stop is compared against. That is the exact harm
// T-0030 and T-0058 were both opened to remove.
