// B12 oracle, group delete-route (D1, blocker).
//
// Written before the product code moved. Contract section 1.2: DELETE
// /api/composer/workflows/[id] answers 409 with the run count unless the
// caller has said `?discardRunHistory=1`, exactly as PUT already does for a
// structural save.
//
// The asymmetry is the defect. `replaceWorkflowGraph` refuses to destroy run
// history without consent; `deleteWorkflow` destroys it on the first ask, and
// the route in front of it never counts. So a workflow with fifty runs and a
// workflow with none are the same one request, and the operator is told
// neither number before the rows are gone.
//
// Doubles: the repository is mocked wholesale (no database), so each
// assertion is about what the ROUTE decided, and "deleteWorkflow was not
// called" is a real statement about the write not happening rather than about
// a row surviving. The GREEN CONTROLs pin the three guards that already work
// and must keep working: the flag, the 404, and the active-runs refusal —
// which has to stay AHEAD of the new count, or a workflow with a running run
// would be offered a "delete the history" button it can never use.
