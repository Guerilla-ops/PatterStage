// THE IMMUTABILITY PROOF for the per-Body progression record (WG-ARCH-003).
//
// The acceptance is that one row per agent profile is immutable, and that a
// correction lands as a NEW ROW with no UPDATE and no DELETE in the write path.
// A comment cannot hold that and a code review cannot keep holding it, so this
// runs the real write path against real SQLite with migration 031's triggers
// armed and asserts the database itself refuses.
//
// The third test is the important one. It does not inspect the repository's
// source for the word UPDATE; it drives `captureAgentProgressionSnapshots`
// through a genuine correction. If the write path ever tried to edit a row
// instead of appending one, the trigger would abort the transaction and this
// test would fail with the trigger's own message. That is a proof about the
// code that runs, not about the code as it currently reads.
