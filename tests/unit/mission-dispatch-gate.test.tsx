/**
 * THE DISPATCH GATE, AND WHAT IT IS FOR (T-0043).
 *
 * The gate is by design: a new mission may not be submitted until the operator
 * has been shown how it will run. What was wrong was never the gate, it was the
 * price of admission. Dispatch opened COLLAPSED, so the only way to satisfy the
 * acknowledgement was to guess that a closed accordion four steps down was the
 * thing standing between you and a disabled button. A competent tester read a
 * working control as a broken form, twice.
 *
 * The operator ruled on 2026-08-26: show the choice instead of demanding a
 * click. Dispatch opens BY DEFAULT and being open IS the acknowledgement.
 *
 * The gate itself stays, and this file still holds it:
 *
 *   - collapse Dispatch and submit is disabled again, with the hint,
 *   - the requirement is stated ON the disabled button (title +
 *     aria-describedby), not only in a paragraph the eye can skip,
 *   - MissionComposerActions still refuses an unacknowledged new mission
 *     when it is handed one.
 *
 * Delete the gate and the collapsed-path cases below go red. That is the
 * point of them: what changed is the DEFAULT, not the rule.
