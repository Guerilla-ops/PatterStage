/**
 * U12 (T-0126): the library is the Story Weaver page.
 *
 * The hub was six tiles, four buttons and three cards; the library was three
 * tiles, three filters and every story. The second is a strict superset of
 * the first, so the hub goes and the library stands at the door. What a
 * reader came to the hub for - how much is written, what is waiting - is in
 * the subtitle and on the filters, not in a tile row above the list it counts
 * (the same rule Skills learned in T-0125).
