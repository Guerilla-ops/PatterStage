/** @jest-environment jsdom */
/**
 * T-0050 acceptance oracle — a mutation's outcome reaches the operator.
 *
 * The live QA pass named this as the single thing it would fix: "silent success
 * and silent failure look identical". It filed the evidence as three separate
 * observations (a dialog that stays open with no toast, a "Save & push" with no
 * confirmation, toasts that vanish mid-keystroke) and diagnosed none of them.
 *
 * There are two concrete causes, and both are in this one component.
 *
 * 1. THE TOAST RENDERS UNDERNEATH THE THING THAT TRIGGERED IT. The ladder is
 *    Toast `z-50`, Sheet backdrop `z-[60]`, Sheet panel `z-[61]`, Modal
 *    `z-[70]`. The Sheet is portaled to document.body and occupies the entire
 *    right edge, which is exactly where the toast is anchored, while the toast
 *    is rendered inline on the page. So every confirmation of a mutation made
 *    from inside a sheet or a modal is covered by it. "No toast appeared" was an
 *    accurate observation of an invisible toast.
 *
 * 2. NOTHING ANNOUNCES IT. Toast carries no `role`, no `aria-live`. The whole
 *    application contains two live regions and neither is the path that serves
 *    73 `showToast` call sites. A screen reader is never told a mutation
 *    succeeded or failed, and a QA harness counting `[role=status]` finds zero
 *    and reasonably concludes nothing fired. This is the same defect shape as
 *    T-0036, where Modal announced itself as a plain div.
 *
 * And one design decision that predates both: `duration = 4000` applies to
 * ERRORS as well as successes, so the reason a mutation failed destroys itself
 * in four seconds whether or not anyone was looking.
